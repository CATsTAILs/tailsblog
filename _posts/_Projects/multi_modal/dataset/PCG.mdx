The datasets are recorded from __9__ different spots including basic 4 spots, __AE,ME,PE,TE__.

The heart sound segmentation is done by Springer's algorithm. [Link](https://physionet.org/content/hss/1.0/). 

You need to download _sample entry_ and could run the algorithm written in MATLAB code.

Since the algorithm uses a __HMM__(Hidden Markov Model), you might need trained coefficients stored in the same folder.
