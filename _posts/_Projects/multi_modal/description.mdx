# TODO

* ~~__Update manual__ (논리값, 검사항목 별로 디테일하게, till __9/21 Mon.__)~~

* ~~Check _Sequence diagram_~~

* Otto's suggestions
    1. Train __BOSS__ on each leads then combine them into a voting system.
    2. Parallel ECG. (1024 channels with an array of length 12)
    3. Plot 12 leads in an one picture, and learn with them.

* ~~Check tags in .dcm files~~

# Dataset


## Summary

total: 841 + 1630 + 121 = 2592

number of ecgs : 841 + 3718 + 284 = 4843

## SNUBH

total: 841 patients, 

* 841+1 _ecg_ s, only _14138175_ has additional .pdf file

* 841+1 _dcm_ s, only _11790860_ has 2 .dcm files but both are the same.

* 841+4 _pcg_ s, _10012606_, _29861129_, _25264043_, _22270614_ has 2 .pcm files

### ECG

length of waves: consistence?

Voltage calibration(1 mV): 0 to 200

## SEVERANCE

## ECG 
* There is a kind of dependency between lead __I__, __II__, __III__, __aVR__, __aVL__ and __aVF__. [ref](https://ecgwaves.com/topic/ekg-ecg-leads-electrodes-systems-limb-chest-precordial/)

__Einthoven's rule__: $\text{lead I} + \text{lead III} = \text{lead II}$

__Goldberger's equation__
$$
\text{aVL} = \frac{\text{lead I} - \text{lead II}}{2} \\
-\text{aVR} = \frac{\text{lead I} + \text{lead III}}{2} \\
\text{aVF} = \frac{\text{lead II} + \text{lead III}}{2}
$$

Inversely, one can obtain lead I, II and III data from aVR, aVL and aVF.
$$
\text{lead I} = \text{aVL} - \text{aVR} + \text{aVF}
$$
$$
\text{lead II} = - \text{aVL} - \text{aVR} + \text{aVF}
$$
$$
\text{lead III} = \text{aVL} + \text{aVR} + \text{aVF} 
$$

## ML

Reconstruct DNN introduced here. [Ng19](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/ecg2/)/[GIT](https://github.com/awni/ecg)

.. the same structure with the network in older paper [Ng17](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01836) (both are Ng's paper)

The ECG of chinese has been downloaded. Ref: [ICBEB2018](http://2018.icbeb.org/Challenge.html)


### Worth to try
> ordered by the priority

1. ~~DNN with smaller leads('cause of dependency over 12 leads), ref: [12LeadsCNN](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15432-4)/[GIT](https://github.com/antonior92/automatic-ecg-diagnosis)~~
2. DNN with two CNNs, one for lead I & II and the other for lead$\text{V}n$'s.
3. Interpretable Machine Learning
4. Machine Learning related to image classification, __e.g.__ EfficientNet?
5. RNN(Too many calculations?) / LSTM? or other kinds of DNN
6. Pipeline for 1D -> 2D (Recurrence plot?)


# Need to check

1. BOSS alg : Bag-of-SFA Symbols
2. ~~Learn on 12 leads(or 8 leads) to judge disease vector (not true/false only)~~
    * Too small abnormal data per each disease to learn(in fact, ratios of abnormal case are about 90%).
3. AutoEncoder (Kingma's thesis?)

# About New Dataset
> 21/04/01

In .xlsx file, pid doesn't give a 1-1 correspondence.

e.g. '2750417'

SEV/ECG3가 patient id를 다시 넘버링 한 정황이보임

Q. 중복 데이터 in new DB (이름으로 봐서)
A. SEV,HY: 있음, SNU: 없음

Q. In HY, ECG1 == ECG2?
A. |ECG1| >> |ECG2|, There is no inclusion

Q. 예전 데이터가 포함되어 있나?
A. 파일 이름들의 inclusion 관계를 조사했을 때, 이번 데이터에 예전 데이터가 모두 들어있음

Q. SEV/ECG3 가 SEV/ECG1, SEV/ECG2의 정보를 모두 포함하고 있나?
A. 개수로 봐선 전혀 아님

Q. 그래서 우리가 가지고 있는 label 수는?
A. SEV = 237, HNU = 621(400), SNU = 924, total = ?!

Q. old <-> new pid 사이의 intersection이 있는지 (SEV only)
A. Nope

Q. SNUB, HY의 경우에 폴더이름 = extract된 이름 인지
A. Yes
