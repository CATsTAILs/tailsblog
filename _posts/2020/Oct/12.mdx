# How to Read Paper(S.keshav) - [pdf](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs244/papers/HowtoReadPaper.pdf)

__Purpose to write this paper__

young researcher waste much effort to learn how to read a paper efficiently. 

This is a paper for author's developed method which consists of _three-passes_.

1. 

Read title, abstract, introduction, section/subsection headings and conclusion, __things summaried already__.

Then, Glance over __references__. You could be able to answer to the five questions(_5 Cs_).
$$
\text{Category, Context, Correctness, Contributions, Clarity}
$$

As a final step, answer this question: __Is it interesting to you?__

2.

Look at the figures, tables, diagrams, illustrations, $\cdots$ _etc_, then mark ___unread___ __references for further reading__.

You can decide then to read paper further, to put aside it temporarily, or to find other paper to read.

At the end of this _pass_, you should __be able to summarize the main thrust__ of the paper with supporting evidence.

3.

__Virtually re-implement the paper__ with same subject, same materials, but go through it by yourself.

It helps you to fully understand the paper. Make the paper your own.

## Time Taking

5 min. + 1 hrs. + (1-5) hrs.

## Example 

During a literature survey in a field that you are unfamiliar with,

> 1. With research engine such as _Google Scholar_ or _CiteSeer_ with well-chosen keywords, find __recent__ papers in the area. Do the first pass with reading _related work_ sections.
> 
> 2. If you can find a survey paper, read it. If not, Do the second pass to find shared/repeated __name__ then go to his/her websites. 
>
> Then, check one's recent workings, you can find the top conferences in that field.
>
> 3. Try to find a key paper among recent proceedings of the conferences, find a key paper in that field.

__New Strategy!__

Check _Partition_ of numbers on each block, vertical/horizontal lines.

The basic strategy (find only one slot for the specific number) is one of special case of the above strategy.

For example, as you fill in some numbers in the above table, there is a moment that it is to hard to find the next number.

At that time, you should check the upper-left block. then,

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
&&1 \\
\hline
&3& \\
\hline
&& \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$
The places for $4,5,7,9$ are restricted to $(1,1),(2,3),(3,1)$ and $(3,3)$.

It implies that $2,6,8$ should be in $(1,2),(2,1),(3,2)$. 

And neighborhood numbers will tell you the location of $2,6$ and $8$.

# Knot to do

* Investigate a relation between epsilon sequences of $S(\alpha,\beta)$ and $S(\alpha, \beta')$.

* Find ORS forms manually by dividing $V$ of $S(\alpha,\beta)$  by precalculated $V$ of $S(\alpha',\beta')$ with $\alpha`$ smaller than $\alpha$.

* Make conjectures on formulae of Conway form(or Schubert form) of knots having reducible $V=g(u)$.
