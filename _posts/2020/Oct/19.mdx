# Image Quality Assessment

## BRISQUE

> Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator

1. Full-Reference IQA

2. Reduced-Reference IQA (e.g. watermarked images are  being standard)

3. Objective Bline / No-Reference IQA

Database : [TID2008](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/TID2008-%E2%80%93-A-database-for-evaluation-of-visual-Ponomarenko-Lukin/6dd37b57f3391b438fa588f98a1c2067365ae5ca?p2df)

Mean Quality Score : (0 to 100) mean score of  

Differences between _natural_ and _artificial_ images

1. pixel intensity, one of natural images follows gaussiasn distribution after normalization(__MSCN__).

2. relations of each pixels with neighborhoods

### STEPS

1. Extract 5 matrices, 1 MSCN image and 4 _pairwise product image_.

2. Calculate $36 \times 1$ feature vector(18 for original image, 18 for half downsized image). __GGD__ and __AGGD__ is used.

3. Predict scores by using Support Vector Machine(__LIBSVM__) after scailing the vector from -1 to 1.

### MSCN coefficients

* Gaussianblur: Apply Imagefilter with the gaussian distribution filter, __i.e.__ matrix (of given size) whose sum of coeff=1, follows Gaussian dist.

## Notes

* BRISQUE seems to assess known-filtered images. Unfortunately, our case sholud deal with 

## Database

* TID2008 : The database used for __BRISQUE__ project. It is invalid now

* KonIQ-10K : Similar database with TID2008, 10,073 quality scored images.
