## How to merge a branch with just a single commit-message?

[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) [번역](https://djkeh.github.io/articles/How-to-write-a-git-commit-message-kor/)

1. All of the committed message are integrated
```bash
git merge feature_branch  # @ master branch
```

2. All the messages are merged into one message.
```bash
git merge --squash feature_branch
git commit -m 'Feature commit messages are merged into this message'
```

3. 
```bash
git cherry-pick -n <commit-name>  # -n : do not commit after merging messages
```
