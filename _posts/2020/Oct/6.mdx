# Knot
Read the introduction chapter of [Octahedral developing of knot complement I: pseudo-hyperbolic structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02928)

What _Thurstun_ did: works on the hyperbolic geometry of knot complements(for _hyperbolic knots_) from its knot diragram.

one of these works, it is well known that a knot complement having a hyperbolic strcuture is equipped with the _developing_ map from its universal cover to $\mathbb{H}^3$. and it gives us a holonomy representation into $\rm{PSL}_2\mathbb{C}$.

It is able to be generalized by ___pseudo developing map___ and ___pseudo hyperbolic strucutre___.

These are obtained via elimination of the edge's angle sum condition in the ideal triangulation for hyerbolic knots.

Then one can get a octahedral decomposition for the complement of a general knot or link.

knot invariants, which were the invariants of hyperbolic knots, can be derived from octahedral decomposition. __e.g.__ complex volume or cusp shapes.

There are several ways to decompose octahedral into tetrahdral in general, but two decompositions, namely, $4$-term or $5$-term decomposition will be used.

$4$-term decomposition is related to _Kashaev invaraints_ and $5$-term decomposition is related to his $R$-matrix.

and the idea of the decomposition is observed first in the $Kashaev$'s works on the above values.

In $4$-term decopmosition, the conditions induced conditions for the ratio $z$ variables. 

In $5$-term decomposition, the conditions induced conditions for the colored Jones polyomial. ($w$ polyonmial)

* _Ptolemy coordinates_ and cluster algebra will be related to the paper...
