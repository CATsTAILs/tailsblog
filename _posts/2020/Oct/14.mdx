# Dictionary

__discrepancy__ : 불일치

# ML

Concepts makes me confused usually:
$$
\text{AI} \subset \text{ML} \subset \text{ANN} \subset \text{DL}
$$

__ML__ : A process of learning by _trainable_ machine. 

The definitions of _trainable_ are suggested by Mitchell Tom and Arthur Samuel, thoese are the followings respectively:

> _Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed_.
>
> _A computer program is said to learn from experience __E__ with respect to some task __T__ and some performance measure __P__,_ 
>
> _if its performane on __T__, as measured by __P__, improves with experience __E__._

__ML__ consists of 3 parts: 
$$
\text{Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning}
$$

__DL__ is a kind of Artificial Neural Network that mimics Human's brain neural network.

It consists of __MLP__(Multi-Layer Perceptrone), which is a structure of neureons of machines.
