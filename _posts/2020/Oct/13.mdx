# Gramma

## Parentheses and Period

Q. Where punctuation be located in the case of exsistence of _parentheses_?

1. Parentheses of a complete sentence is located at the end of the sentence.

> One period for a main sentence, and the other period for a sentence in parentheses.

> Reidemeister move is a deformation method of knot. (It is a basic skill when one finds unknow manually.)
 
2. Parentheses of an incomplete sentence(phrase/clause etc.) is located at the end of the sentence.

> No period for a main sentence, just only one period at the end of sentences, right after parenthese.

> Riley polynomial is reducible when it is reducible on $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ (and the other fields).

3. Parentheses of a complete sentence(phrase/clause etc.) is located in the middle of a snentence.

> No period at the end of parenthesis with first small letter.

> Octahedron method (it is writtend by members of _VC_ seminar) is used to find volumes of each components.

4. Parentheses of an incomplete sentence(phrase/clause etc.) is located in the middle of a snentence.

> Junior  in front of the left parenthesis. 

> The process of normalization is done in _window10_ (and also in _ubuntu_), which is not a important step for components of $u$.


# Meeting with Seonhwa Kim

## Advices

1 year for finding a valuable problem that I can solve, 1 year for investigation on the problem, and another 1 year for solving it.

That's why you should start to think about a subject of your thesis.

> Divide and Conquer, It is time to concentrate on small things. Set the priority and then do that.

There are things to do, and positions that you should be on it _at that age_. If you are not available for those, then you will fall through. (in the field of your)

As a doctor student, you need to find ___your own___ statement, which is notrized by master of the field where the statement lying.

And that statement will be solved __by yourself__. (allowed some supports, but almost all of the contribution should be yours.)

_Last_ thing is about _presentation_, you need to practice how to build a story of a presentation.

For example, a kind of _good_ presentation in mathematics spends one-third of a given time to recall basics(definitions, key idea of the field etc.).

Seonhwa Kim and Hyuk Kim is willing to listen my presentation. Only things to be done is to find appropriate subjects, which contain interests of their(and my).

## Ideas

___TDA on ML!___

just _investigation_ step:

What topology do graphs of each models/networks generate? does it contain any information about standards for _good_ network?

## Roadmap

1. Papers

There are 4 papers will be written. two are in writting now, and the other two will be written with me, 

calculations about upto 11 crossings, about deformed cases

2. Dataset

Complete a _appendable_ system. It is complete system for knots, but other features will be added in the future.

First thing to take care is $\partial$-cases.

3. Sharing

All the things we did will be uploaded on a website. the site will be linked personel hompages.
