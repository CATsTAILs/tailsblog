# Sheaf
---
* Gluing Equation can be written as

$$
0 \rightarrow \mathcal{F}(U) \rightarrow \prod \mathcal{F}(U_i)  \rightrightarrows \mathcal{F}(U_i \cup U_j)
$$

where $\mathcal{F}$ is a functor from a category of open sets to some structured category.

'$\rightrightarrows$' indicates an _Equalizer_. 

* étalé = to spread out

* For a two ringed spaces $(X, \mathcal{O}_X), (Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)$, a __morphism__ from $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ to $(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)$ is a pair 
$$
(f:X\rightarrow Y, \varphi:\mathcal{O}_Y \to f_.(\mathcal{O}_X))
$$
__NOTE__: $f$ does not induce $\phi$, but induce $f_.(\mathcal{O}_X)$ where $f_.(\mathcal{O}_X)(U) = \mathcal{O}_Y(f^{-1}(U))$.

## __Godement resolution__

__Idea__: global(esp. cohomological) information about a sheaf in terms of local information is coming form its stalks.

where $\mathcal{F}$ is a sheaf over $X$,
$$
\text{Gode}(\mathcal{F})(U):= \prod_{x \in U}\mathcal{F}_x\ ^\forall \text{open subset } U \subseteq X
$$

Then, $\text{Gode}(\mathcal{F})$ becomes a presheaf, further, flabby sheaf.

Finally, $\text{Gode}$ becomes functor with a natural transformation between identity functor and itself.

(flabby sheaf: all of the restriction of the sheaf is surjective.)



## __Adapted class__

Given an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ and a left-exact functor $\mathcal{F}$ from $\mathcal{A}$, 

a class of objects $\mathcal{R} \subset \mathcal{A}$ is adapted to $\mathcal{F}$ if it satisfies the followings:

> * stable under finite direct sums
> * $\mathcal{F}$ acts like exact in $\text{Kom}^+(\mathcal{R})$
> * any object from $\mathcal{A}$ is a subobject of an object from $\mathcal{R}$

* If $\mathcal{A}$ contains sufficiently many injective objects, then the class of all injective objects is an adapted to any left-exact functor from $\mathcal{A}$

# What to check
---
* the section functor with a given open set is _left-exact_. 

Especially, the global section functor is left-exact.

* Let $M$ be a manifold with a structured sheaf $\mathcal{O}_M: U \rightarrow \{$ smooth fcts on $U\}$. 

The sheaf $\mathcal{E}:U \rightarrow \{$ smooth serctions of $\rho$ on $U \}$ is an $\mathcal{O}_M$-modules.

Then the category of sheaves associated to a vector bundle are not form of __Abelian category__

Check $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}: (x,v) \rightarrow (x, xv)$ is an example for not being abaelian.

* If you want to download a video uploaded on __eTL__(_etl.snu.ac.kr_), then do not use the followings:

__Problems__: It is out-of-date, especially, a module it requires,  _snulogin_(developed by the developer of the above module) fails to login.
