## ROC

> Receiver Operating Characteristic

A curve which starts at $(0,0)$ and ends at $(1,1)$. It is used to evaluate learning models.

* $x$-coordinate: _FPR_(False Positive Rate) = 1 - TNR

* $y$-coordinate: _TPR_ (False Positive Rate)

TPR, TNR and FPR, FNR are values calculated from TP, TN, FP, FN which are ususally used to describe performace of binary classification models.

__i.e.__ when one gives a sample to the machine, then the sample is:

1. __TP__: True Positive when Machine says positive and it is true.
2. __TN__: True Negative when Machine says negative and it is true.
3. __FP__: False Positive when Machine says positive and it is false.
4. __FN__: False Negative when Machine says negative and it is false.

then TPR(recall, sensitivity), TNR(specificity), FPR, FNR and PPV(precision) are following below formulae:
$$
\text{TPR} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} = 1 - \text{FNR}
$$
$$
\text{TNR} = \frac{TN}{TN + FP} = 1 - \text{FPR}
$$
$$
\text{PPV} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
$$

In other words, __TPR__($y$-axis) is a ratio of correct judgement over positive samples and __FPR__($x$-axis) is a ratio of incorrect judgement over negative samples.

These values is depending on __threshold__, a reference value to judge class.

For example, suppose the machine says a sample is positive with a probability $p$ and threshold is $0.6$. 

Then the sample is classified as positive if $p > 0.6$, as negative if $p \leq 0.6$.

__How to draw ROC?__

1. Rearrange samples by ascending order of probability.
2. Set the threshold to first samples's probability.
3. Calculate $(\text{FPR}, \text{TPR})$, plot the point.
4. Increase the threshold to set it the probability of the next sample,
5. Repeat __2.__ to __4.__ until threshold is over all the probability of samples.

__NOTE:__ FPR is increasing in the above procedure, since $FP$ is increasing in FPR = $\frac{FP}{TN+FP}$.

## BOSS?

__command logging all the prints with errors__ (and choose graphic card to use)
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3 python3 main.py 2>&1 | tee logs.log
```

$\mathfrak{sl}(n, F)$ is a algebra of matrices with trace zero.

> At $I \in SL_n$, Flow is described as $e^{tX}$ for some matrix $X$.
>
> Since $\det{e^{tX}}$ = e^{t \cdot \tr{X}}, the flow is on $SL_n$ if and only if $\text{tr}{X} = 0$.

$\underline{\text{Ad}}_a: G \to G, g \mapsto aga^{-1} = L_a R_{a^{-1}}g$ implies a endomorphism on the lie group $\mathfrak{g}$. 
$$
\text{Ad}_a : \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g}, X \mapsto \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} a \cdot \text{exp}(tX) \cdot a^{-1}
$$

$d(L_a \circ R_{a^{-1}} \circ \text{exp}(tX)) = dL_a \circ dR_{a^{-1}} \circ X = dR_{a^{-1}} X$ since $X \in \mathfrak{g}$ is a left invariant vector field.
