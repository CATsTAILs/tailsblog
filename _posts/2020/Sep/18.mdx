# Geometry

## Chern Conjecture

* Affine manifold

There are 3 definitions. The itelic terms in the definitions will be treated below.

1.

A differentiable ($C^\infty$) manifold with _flat_ and _torsion free_ connections.

2.

A manifold covered by an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with _monodromy_ acting by _affine transformations_. 

3.

A manifold is equipped with an atlas (called an affine structure) on which transition functions are _affine transformations_.

There are ingredients.

> A connection is said to be __flat__ if its curvature form $\Omega \equiv 0$. 
>
> It is interpreted as "The structure group can be reduced to the same underlying group but with the discrete topology."

> A conenction $\nabla$ is __torsion free__ if it satisfies
>
> $\nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X - [X, Y] = 0$
>
> it is one of conditions that a _Levi-Chivita_ connection should satisfy.

> For a given covering $p: \tilde{X} \to X$ with fibre $F$ where $X$ is connected, locally connected base topological space with a base point $x$.
>
> then one can consider a loop on $X$, $\gamma : [0, 1] \to X$ based $x$, and its lift to $\tilde{X}$, $\tilde{\gamma}$. the end point of $\tilde{\gamma}$ is different with $\tilde{x}$ (one point of $p^{-1}(x)$) usually,
>
> and there is a group action of $\pi_1 (X, x)$ on $F$. i.e. there is a group homomorpihsm
>
> $\pi_1(X, x) \to \text{Aut}(H_*(F_x))$, it is called __monodromy action__.

> __Affine transformation__ is a transformation between two vector spaces acts like $ax + b$, transformation preserving colinearity and ratios of distances.
>
> In other words, it preserves lines and parallelism.

__Chern's conjecture__

Q. Affine manifold has always Euler characteristic $0$?
