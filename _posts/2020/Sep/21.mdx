Connection: A choice of horizontal space.

For a given principal fiber bundle, $\phi: P \to B$, 

__A vertical space__ is a $\text{ker}(d\phi)$.

__A horizontal space__, $\Gamma$, is a $\text{ker}(w)$ for a connection 1 form on $P$.

__NOTE:__ A vertical space does not depend on the choice of $w$ eventhough this is not the case for $\Gamma$.

_tensor_ means that it is $C^\infty$-linear. __e.g.__ Torsion tensor, $T(X,Y) = \nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X - [X, Y]$.

$w \in \Omega^r_B(V)$ is $(V, \rho)$-__pseudo tensorial__ if $R_g^*(w) =\rho(g^{-1}) \cdot w$

pseudo tensorial form $w$ is tensorial if $w(X_1, \cdots, X_r) = 0$ if and only if one of $X_i$'s is in $\text{ker}(w)$, horizontal space.

For a given tensorial form $\alpha$ on $\phi: P \to B$, one can define a form on $B$
$$
\bar{\alpha}_b(X_1, \cdots, X_r) := [p, \alpha_p (\tilde{X_1}, \cdots, \tilde{X_r})] \in E_b.
$$
where $E$ is an associated bundle to $\phi$.
