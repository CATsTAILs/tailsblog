_Connection in the view of tangent bundles_

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold, $\zeta$ be a complex $n$-bundle. Then connection is defined as a $\mathbb{C}$ linear mapping
$$
\nabla : C^\infty(\zeta) \to C^\infty(TM^*_\mathbb{C} \otimes \zeta)
$$
satisfying the _Leibniz rule_.
$$
\nabla(fs) = df\otimes s + f\nabla s
$$

Then some properties of connections are derived from the definition.

__Prop 0__ 

$\nabla$ is a local operator. __i.e.__ $\text{supp}(s) \supset \text{supp}(\nabla s)$
>
> It is sufficient to show that $^\forall x$ such that $s(x) = 0$ then $\nabla s(x) = 0$. 
> 
> Take any point $x$ at which $s=0$ with a function $f$ such that $f=1$ in neighborhood of $x$, a region where $s$ vanishes, and $f=0$ in $\text{supp}(s)$.
>
> Then, by the definition of connection, $0 = 0 + \nabla s$ at $x$.

__Prop 1__

$\nabla_{X_1}s = \nabla_{X_2}s$ at $x$ whenever $X_1 = X_2$ at $x$
>
> Properties of tensor / tensor bundle?
>
> $\nabla s (x) \in \text{Hom}_\mathbb{C}(\mathfrak{X}(M), C^\infty(\zeta_x))$

__Prop 2__

$\nabla_X s_1(x) = \nabla_X s_2(x)$ if $s_1 = s_2$ on for some open subset $U \in x$.

> Trivia? __CHECK__.

Connection is written locally when a patch of $M$, $U$ such that $\zeta |_U \cong U \times \mathbb{C}^n$ with complex frames $\{s_1, s_2, \cdots, s_n\}$.
$$
\nabla s_j = \sum \omega^i_j \otimes s_i
$$
__NOTE__: $\omega^i_j$ is not a $(1,1)$ tensor's coordinate. Check $\nabla$ is not a tensor and $\omega^i_j$ is an element of a matrix of $1$ forms.

Even the theory expands on complex bundle settings, one can find relation between connections in a real setting and one in a complex setting.

__i.e.__ $s_k = u_k + i v_k$ where $u, v$ are in a real vector space. __CHECK__


__Exterior derivative__

Remark $K:= \hat{\nabla}\cdot\nabla$ for real manifold cases.

Similary, they are defined in $\mathbb{C}$-vector bundles sense.
$$
\hat{\nabla}: C^\infty(\wedge^k \tau^*_\mathbb{C} \otimes \zeta) \to C^\infty(\wedge^{k+1}\tau^*_\mathbb{C} \otimes \zeta)
$$
when it sends $\theta \otimes s$ to $d\theta \otimes s + (-1)^k \theta \wedge \nabla s$.

And define _curvature form_ $K:= \hat{\nabla}\nabla$. Locally,
$$
K(s_j) := \Omega^i_j \otimes s_i
$$
where $\Omega^i_j$ is a $2$-form on $U \subset M$.

Then by definition,
$$
\Omega^i_j = d\omega^i_j + \sum \omega^i_k \wedge \omega^k_j
$$

$\omega, \Omega$ denotes $n \times n$ matrix of differential $1$ or $2$ fomrs. So the above formula is written as
$$
\Omega = d\omega + \omega \wedge \omega
$$

__Invariant Polynomial__

Let $p: M_n(\mathbb{C}) \to \mathbb{C}$, a complex valued function on $n \times n$ matrices such that $p(TXT^{-1}) = P(X)$. (It equals to $p(XY) = p(YX)$).

Since the choice of local frames change culvature forms by conjugacy, one can define a function of $K$.

__Fundamental Lemma__
$$
p:\text{inv. poly} \Rightarrow d(p(K)) = 0
$$
__i.e.__ closed form $[p(K)] \in H^\cdot_{\text{dR}} (M;\mathbb{C})$

__Cor__

$[p(K_\nabla)]$ is independent on \nabla.

___pf___
$$
\begin{matrix}
\iota^* p^* \zeta & \to & p^* \zeta & \to & \zeta \\
\end{matrix}
$$
