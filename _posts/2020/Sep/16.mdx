## Curves on the projective plane

> Curves whoese degree $\geq 3$

Let $C$ be a curve on $\mathbb{P^2}$ generated by one homogeneous polynomial $f$. then __Hessian__ , $H$, is defined as follows:
$$
H = \det 
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_0^2} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_0 \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_0 \partial x_2} \\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_0} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1^2} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} \\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_0} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2^2}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

* If $C$ has a inflection point $p$, then the value of $H$ at $p$ is $0$.

* It is the same as the Jacobian matrix of the gradient of $f$, $H(f(x)) =J(\nabla f(x))$.

>
> By homogenization, $f = ayz^{d-1} + z^{d-2} h(x,y) + \cdots$ and its Hessian is $(d-1)^2 a^2 \frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial^2 x^2}$.
>
> It is $0$ if and only if $h(x,y) = y(bx + cy)$

The above proof implies that $C$ looks like a tangent line in degree $\leq 3$ since $f(x,y,z) = y(a+bx+cy) + \cdots \text{ in } \mathbb{A}^2$ ($a+bx+cy \neq 0$).

And $f$ and its tangent line meets $3$ times at $p$ and there is no intersection between them except $p$.

If a degree of $C$ is larger than or equal to $3$, then there exists an inflection point on $C$.

__Theorem__ (Bézout)

Two curves in $\mathbb{P}^2$, one is of degree $m$, and the other is of degree $n$ then the inetersection is not empty.

Futhermore, If the intersection is finite point, then its cardinality $\leq mn$. The equality holds when two curves are generic.

> If it is not possible to find the appropriate variable, then one can check that variables are able to be separated.
>
> Then find the solution of resultant $R(f,g)$ about $z$ with $x=1$. If there is a root, let it $\beta$. If not, let $\beta$ be a solution of $R(f,g)$ about $z$ with $y=1$.

>

>
> Arrange $f(x,y,1)$, $g(x,y,1)$ and take resultant about $y$, obtain a root of $x$. the number of obtained roots is $1$ or $0$ because of the uniqueness of $x$-coordinate.
>
> If $f$, $g$ are generic, then a resultant doesn't have multiple roots, so the cardinality of intersection is eqult to $mn$.

__Hilbert's 16th Problem__

Harnack investigated algebraic curve $C$ of degree $d$ in the real projeective plane $\mathbb{P}_\mathbb{R}^2 could have no more than
$$
\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2} + 1
$$
connected components (rings !). It is prooved by using Bézout's theorem.

_e.g._ $V_\mathbb{R}(y^2 z - x(x^2 + t))$ has one ring if $t>0$, has two ring if $t<0$.

___pf___

$\mathbb{P}_\mathbb{R}^2$ has two kinds of closed curve. One can consider a disk model of $\mathbb{P}_\mathbb{R}^2$.

Then, there is a closed curve lying in interior of the dist, and one having a intersection with the boundary of the disk.

In the other words, one divide disk into two components, but the other one divide disk into only one component.

Suppose that $C$ is $m+1$ components where $m = \frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2} + 1$, let them $C_1, \cdots, C_{m+1}$.

Since they have no intersection points, at most one one component is of the second type. (why?)

Take $(d-3)$ arbitrary points in $C_{m+1}$ and choose $p_i$ in $C_i$ arbirary.

$\dim \mathbb{R}[x_0, \cdots ]_{d-2} = \frac{d(d-1}{2} > m + d - 3$ implies that there is a curve $D$ which contain all the points chosen.

the number of intersection points between $D$ and $C$ would be $2\times m+ (d-3)$. It contradicts __Bézout__'s theorem.

__NOTE__: Hilbert's 16th problem is a relation between components of a curve of dimension 6 in real projective plane.
