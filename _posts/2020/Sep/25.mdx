## GIT: How to remove remote branch

Suppose you made a branch named 'NEW' and you pushed it to the remote repository.

1. Delete local branch
```bash
git branch -d NEW
```

GIT might recommend the following command:

```bash
git branch -D NEW
```

2. Delete remote branch by using _push_
```bash
git push origin --delete NEW
```

## Network OSI7 Layer

Standard structure for network system.

From this, one can deduce that some superficial layers are not affected by other interior layers.

1. __Physical Layer__,
A layer consists of Bits. Most hidden layer, transport bit flow via physical objects.

2. __Data Link Layer__,
A layer consists of Layers. It is used to detect errors in a process of transportation of data. __MAC__ address is involed in this layer.

3. __Network Layer__,
__IP__(location), __Route__(root) are involed in this layer, a layer to trasport _packets_.

$$
\uparrow \text{ Lower Layer -------------------- Upper Layer } \downarrow
$$

4. __Transport Layer__,
__TCP/UDP__ protocol is involed in this layer. Its header includes the information about port number. Units are _segment_(TCP) and _datagram_(UDP).

5. __Session Layer__,
This layer is related to _session_ as its name. It maintains the connection between receiver and transmitter. __TCP/IP__ session and __OS__(?) involed in this layer.  

6. __Presentation Layer__,
Encoding or decoding is done by this layer. It tells a format of a given data and gives it to the _application layer_ when the network is a receiver. __MIME__ encoding is involed in this layer. 

7. __Application Layer__,
Most superficial layer, only the layer user can meet. It makes users touch networks. Network __API__ is done in this layer.



The process of transportation is:
$$
\begin{matrix}
7 & \to & 6 & \to & 5 & \to & 4 & \to & 3 & \to & 2 & \to & 1 \\
& & & & & & & & & & & & \downarrow \\
7' & \leftarrow & 6' & \leftarrow & 5' & \leftarrow & 4' & \leftarrow & 3' & \leftarrow & 2' & \leftarrow & 1'
\end{matrix}
$$
where the numbers with _prime_ indicates the receiver's layers

__Result__

For the $2$-bridge knot, $S(p, q)$, a torsion of meridian is calculated as:
$$
\mathbb{T}_\mu(\mathcal{X}_\rho) = \pm \frac{m^{e_k +1}}{2(m^2-1)} \cdot \frac{w_{11}}{v_{11} \phi_v} \cdot \frac{\partial \phi_w}{\partial u}
$$
where $\mu$ is a meridean , $e_k$ is $k$th epsilon in the epsilon sequence from the _Schubert_ form of $K$, $S(p,q)$, $\phi$'s are _Riley_ polynomials.

and other details are not known for me...

__CHECK:__ Awesome diagram consists of two vertical lines and one curve which consists of several parallel diagonals. (u know what I mean)
