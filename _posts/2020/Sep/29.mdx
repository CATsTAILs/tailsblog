## Fox's trapezoidal conjecture

Let $K$ be an alternating knot with the _Alexander polynomial_ 
$$
\Delta_K(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{2n} (-1)^j a_j t^{2n-j}, a_j>0
$$
Then,
$$
a_0 < a_1 < \cdots < a_{n-m-1} < a_{n-m} = \cdots = a_{n+m} > a_{n+m+1} > \cdots > a_{2n}
$$

This conjecture is well known as __Fox's trapezoidal conjecture__.

One can calculate _Riley polynomial_ up to 11 crossings for each crossing and for each component.

__Observation__

* Almost of them have _trapzoidal_ Riley polynomial.

* u-polynomial depends on the choice of $g(u)$.
