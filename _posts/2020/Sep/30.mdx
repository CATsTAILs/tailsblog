## Fox's trapezoidal conjecture

* Solved for _alternating_ or _2-bridge_ knots.

* New conjecture for Riley polynomials?

* Riley polynomial of $8_20$ at 3rd crossing is not trapezoidal.
But the problem is that calculated Riley polynomials of $8_20$ doesn't correspond to the result that provided from 조윤희 교수님.
And the riley polynomial, which is not trapezoidal, is not in the previous result, check is needed.

* Conjecture: g(u) or g(-u) is trapezoidal(when one substitute t+1/t instead of u) 

> __False__. but when you take absolute values of coefficient, there are some trapezoidal polynomials.

## Riley polynomial

* Riley polynomial of $10_{124}$ has low degree($8$)
