# Sheaf

__ReView__

Direct limit(colimit, inductive limit) is exact.

The direct image functor induce from $f:X \to Y$, $f_\cdot (\mathcal{F})(U) = \mathcal{F}(f^{-1}(U))$, is left-exact

___why?___: a functor, $\Gamma(U, \_ )$, is left exact.

flabby(늘어진, 무기력한, 힘없는) sheaf: a sheaf whoes restriction maps from $X$ is surjective.

* _A category has enough injective objects_ means that any object is a subobject of an injective one.

where an object $Y$ is said to be _injective_ if $X \mapsto \text{Hom}_\mathscr{A}(X, Y)$ is exact.

* _flabby_ sheaf is interpreted as a sheaf whose sections on any open subset are be able to extend to $X$. 

* From the above facts ... $R\Gamma \circ \Phi = R\Gamma$ where $\Phi: \mathscr{O}_X\text{-mod} \to Sh(Ab)$, the forgetful functor.

$i$-th __Sheaf cohomology__, $H^i(X, \mathcal{F})$, is defined as $R^i \Gamma(\mathcal{F})$.

We consider $\mathcal{F}$ as a element in $\text{Kom}^+(R_X\text{-mod})$ as a sequence of sheaves
$$
\cdots \to 0 \to \mathcal{F} \to 0 \to \cdots 
$$

__Prop__

$R^i f_\cdot (\mathcal{F})$ is a naturally isomorphic to the sheaf associated to the presheaf(sheafification)
$$
U \mapsto H^i(f^{-1}(U), \mathcal{F})
$$
where $U$ is an open subset of $Y$.

___pf___

Let $I^\cdot$ be an injectvie resolution of $\mathcal{F}$, then
$$
R^if_\cdot(\mathcal{F}) = H^i(f_\cdot(I^\cdot))
$$
it is calculated with given open subset $U \subset Y$ as the cohomology of the following sequence:
$$
\begin{matrix}
\cdots & \to & f_\cdot(I^{i-1}) & \to & f_\cdot(I^i) & \to & f_\cdot(I^{i+1}) & \to & \cdots \\
\cdots & \to & f_\cdot(I^{i-1}) & \to & f_\cdot(I^i) & \to & f_\cdot(I^{i+1}) & \to & \cdots
\end{matrix}
$$

Time spent to understand simple notions makes you understand other complicate things with lesser time.

_mathematics is not about understanding complex abstract ideas, but about understanding simple things well._

_For those not familiar with higher mathematics, consider that learning Japanese is much harder than reading a dense Japanese political text given you know the language._
