# Header-links

_header-link_ means that a link containing header information in each post.

For example, [here](https://catstail.netlify.app/2020/_Themes/Gatsby/#header-links) send you to the header above.

It is used for __TOC__(Table Of Contents). A table of lists of headers in an underlying post.

When you click a header in TOC, then it scrolls up(or down) to deliver you to that header.

Let me indtroduce you how to add this function into your Gatsby-blog by using _mdx_.

__NOTE:__ There is another way to do via _remark_. You can search, or just adjust the followings.

First, install a plugin _remark-slug_

```bash
npm install remark-slug
```

And add it this plugin as a option of _gatsby-plugin-mdx_ plugin _gatsby-config.js_ file 

```json:title=gatsby-config.js
const remarkSlug = require(`remark-slug`);
// ...
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
    options: {
        remarkPlugins: [remarkSlug]
    }
  }
// ...
```

After that, add _tableOfContents_ into a quary of mdx in a query of post templates.

__e.g.__
```json:title=src/components/Posts/PostTemplate
export const postQuery = graphql`
  query BlogPostByPath($slug: String!) {
    mdx(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {
      body
      tableOfContents // ADD THIS LINE!
      excerpt
      fields {
        slug
      }
      frontmatter {
        title
        date(formatString: "MM/DD/YYYY")
        tags
      }
    }
  }
`
```

Then just enjoy it :D
