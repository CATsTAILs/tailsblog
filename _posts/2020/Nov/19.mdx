* STUPID question

__Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot?__ (from persistent knot blah blah paper)

Usually, it cannot be.

But by _Fox's re-embedding theorem_, there is an another embedding for being unknot by definition.

__i.e.__ there exists an embedding $g:M \rightarrow S^3$ such that the clousre of $S^3 - g(M)$ is the union of _handlebodies_ for compact connected manifold $M$, which is homotoped to $f$, the given embedding of $M$.

for our cases, $M$ is a knot.

__NOTE:__ A knot $K \subset S^3$ is _unknotted_ if the complement of its regular neighborhood is a solid torus.

~~__NOTE:__ $(S^3 \setminus K) \setminus K_0$ is an _Eilenberg-MacLane_ space. where $K_0$ is a embedded unknot.~~

__NOTE:__ where $L$ is a link, $V$ is a tubular neighborhood of $L$ in $S^3$ then $X = S^3\setminus V \equiv S^3 \setminus L$

As a consequence of Papakyriakopoulos’s Sphere Theorem, $X$ is a __spherical__(?) so $X$ is a _Eilenberg-Maclane_ space $K(G_L, 1)$ for the knot group of $L$.

The followings is the __Sphere Theorem__ of _Papakyriakopoulos.

___Thm___ (Sphere theorem)

> Let $M$ be an orientable 3-manifold, compact or not, with boundary which may be empty, such that $\pi_2 (M) \neq 0$ and which can be _semi-linearly_ imbedded in a 3-manifold $N$, having the following property:
>
> the commutator quotient group of any non-zero subgroup of $\pi_1(N)$ has an element of infinite order.
>
> _Then_, there exists $2$-sphere $S$ semi-lineary embedded in $M$ which is not zero homologous in $M$

* semi-linealy = triagulated?

# TODO

- [ ] Make more models :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D

- [ ] Do some experiments with sound data (feature extracting first?)

- [ ] Autoencoder / how about reading '12 automatic ecg blah blah'

- [ ] Augmentation on training set

- [ ] Read [_Evolution of unknotting strategies for knots and braids_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0787)

- [ ] 1st chapter of Wall's book

- [ ] Cnt comp 생각해보기

- [ ] Recurrence plot?

- [x] Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot? (False, what the author want to say is just there is an another embedding for being unknot (by def.))
