* STUPID question

__Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot?__ (from persistent knot blah blah paper)

ANSWER: It can if _homotopy_ is continuous. consider a homotopy sends not trivial crossings to a point.

it is continuous, but it is __NOT__ differentiable.

__i.e.__ differentiable homotopy(isotopy) doesn't affect the $1$st fundamental group of complement space, however,

continuous homotopy does.

__Basic Knot  Theory__

$$
\begin{matrix}
S^1 & \hookrightarrow & S^3 \\
&& \downarrow \\
S^1 & \hookrightarrow & S^3 \\
\end{matrix}
$$

$$
\begin{matrix}
&& \text{complement homeomorphism} \\
& \swarrow & \\
\text{ambient isotopy} & \rightarrow & \text{complement isotopy}
\end{matrix}
$$

* STUPID question 2

What is a _good condition_ for nerve theorem ?

a hollow cube with cover at each vertices can not form a barcode of sphere?


# ToDo for weekend

* Close Model Theory

* 세훈씨 + 준환씨 코드 구경

* Medifarm (QRS variation, PR variation)

* Handlebodies Ref.

* Autoencoder Ref.

* Rolfsen

* Wall

* Discrete Differential Geometry

* A course in a metric geometry / oudot's book?

* Other references you printed out ...

와! 할게 많다!

# Schedule

* 0933 - 1130: 주말에 할 일 나눠가지기 미팅.. (Medifarm's thing)

* 1130 - 1300: SNUVC Seminar, 윤영호 선생님 발표 앞부분 찾아듣기 (diagram.site/SNUVC/video?)

* 1300 - 1400: RV meeting, 세훈씨 + 준환씨 코드 읽어보기

* 1300 - 2000: meeting with 김선화 선생님, re-embedding problem can be solved by his help(하지만 더 알아봐야될 것들이 생겼다)

* 2000 - 2045: 과자같은거 주워먹고 휴식 ... 왜 시간이 벌써?

* 2045 - 2230: from 1792 with time cut rerun .. 함수를 만들기는 했으나 어떻게 쓰나?

* 2230 - 2503: $\uparrow$ 적용 + 테스트.. 중 comp 개수가 다른것을 발견했으나 v-comp를 고려하지 않아서 달라보이는 것임을 확인하였으며 앞서 계산하는 것을 꺼버렸거나 하는 등의 실수들을 겨우 이겨내고 퇴근

# TODO

- [ ] Make more models :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D

- [ ] Do some experiments with sound data (feature extracting first?)

- [ ] Autoencoder / how about reading '12 automatic ecg blah blah'

- [ ] Augmentation on training set

- [ ] Read [_Evolution of unknotting strategies for knots and braids_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0787)

- [ ] 1st chapter of Rolfsen's book

- [ ] 1st chapter of Wall's book

- [ ] Cnt comp 생각해보기

- [ ] Recurrence plot?

- [x] Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot? Because there is _continuus_ homotopy between  them

- [x] Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot? (False, what the author want to say is just there is an another embedding for being unknot (by def.))

- [ ] Read Ch2. of the thesis written by Kingma

- [ ] stability condition reading

- [ ] Marching cube code 살펴보기

- [ ] CT dcm investigation (necessary?)
