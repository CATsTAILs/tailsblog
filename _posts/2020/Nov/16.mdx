## [Classification of ECG Arrhythmia using Recurrent Neural Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050918307774) 

* Literature Survey

> * What to do in the future
>
> SOM(Self Organizing Maps)
>
> SVM(Support Vecctor Machines) (maybe it's done by TJ)
>
> MLP(Multilayer Perceptron)
>
> Markov Models
>
> Fuzzy or Neuro-fuzzy systems and of various procedures[26-28?]
>
> wavelet trf (as a preprocessing procedure)
>
> direct vector quantization

> probabilistic nn

> fuzzy corssover neural system algorithm
>
> (?) diff. task  for characterization of ECG applying two arrangement strategies; 1-administered learning 2-unlabeled information .. built up a fuzzy rationale based methodology for recognizing ECG arrhythmias and segregating ventricular arrhythmias 
>
> myocardial ischemia detection[8-10]/coronary artery disease detection[11-13], ECG informations are reported as relavant mearsurement.

* Methods
>
> Feed present beat and last beat(__e.g.__ T) into RNN

# TODO

- [ ] Make more models :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D

- [ ] Autoencoder / how about reading '12 automatic ecg blah blah'

- [ ] Cnt comp 생각해보기

- [ ] Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot?

- [ ] Read Ch2. of the thesis written by Kingma

- [ ] stability condition reading

- [ ] Marching cube code 살펴보기

- [ ] image 데이터 추출 및 저장?

- [ ] CT dcm investigation (necessary?)
