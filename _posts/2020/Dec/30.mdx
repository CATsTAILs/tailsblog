* 1800 - 1940: 저녁 + 예감

* 1940 - 2242: 김혁선생님 request부터.. 그것만 (졸기도 하고 ㅠㅠ)

# ToDo

* 1개 빠진 샘플 찾아보기 / Autoencoder? / 새로운 모델(maybe 2d) 구상 / validation protocol 만들기

* Implement PCG envelope

* Segmentation model?

* More training models

# ToDo for weekend(하나도 못했던)

* Prime decomposition method

* Close Model Theory

* 세훈씨 + 준환씨 코드 구경

* Handlebodies Ref.

* Autoencoder Ref.

* Rolfsen

* Wall

* Discrete Differential Geometry

* A course in a metric geometry / oudot's book?

* Other references you printed out ...

# TODO

- [ ] Make more models :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D

- [ ] Do some experiments with sound data (feature extracting first?)

- [ ] Autoencoder / how about reading '12 automatic ecg blah blah'

- [ ] Augmentation on training set

- [ ] Read [_Evolution of unknotting strategies for knots and braids_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0787)

- [ ] 1st chapter of Rolfsen's book

- [ ] 1st chapter of Wall's book

- [ ] Cnt comp 생각해보기

- [ ] Recurrence plot?

- [x] Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot? Because there is _continuus_ homotopy between  them

- [x] Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot? (False, what the author want to say is just there is an another embedding for being unknot (by def.))

- [ ] Read Ch2. of the thesis written by Kingma

- [ ] stability condition reading

- [ ] Marching cube code 살펴보기

- [ ] CT dcm investigation (necessary?)

- [ ] Diagram drawing 코드 분석(command only, 실행이라도 시켜보기)

- [ ] PrimeDecomposition 원리 분석

- [ ] Sphere packing algorithm
