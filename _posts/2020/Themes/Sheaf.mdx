* Gluing Equation can be written as

$$
0 \rightarrow \mathcal{F}(U) \rightarrow \prod \mathcal{F}(U_i)  \rightrightarrows \mathcal{F}(U_i \cup U_j)
$$

where $\mathcal{F}$ is a functor from a category of open sets to some structured category.

'$\rightrightarrows$' indicates an _Equalizer_. 

* étalé = to spread out

* For a two ringed spaces $(X, \mathcal{O}_X), (Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)$, a __morphism__ from $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ to $(Y, \mathcal{O}_Y)$ is a pair 
$$
(f:X\rightarrow Y, \varphi:\mathcal{O}_Y \to f_.(\mathcal{O}_X))
$$
__NOTE__: $f$ does not induce $\phi$, but induce $f_.(\mathcal{O}_X)$ where $f_.(\mathcal{O}_X)(U) = \mathcal{O}_Y(f^{-1}(U))$.

## __Godement resolution__

__Idea__: global(esp. cohomological) information about a sheaf in terms of local information is coming form its stalks.

where $\mathcal{F}$ is a sheaf over $X$,
$$
\text{Gode}(\mathcal{F})(U):= \prod_{x \in U}\mathcal{F}_x\ ^\forall \text{open subset } U \subseteq X
$$

Then, $\text{Gode}(\mathcal{F})$ becomes a presheaf, further, flabby sheaf.

Finally, $\text{Gode}$ becomes functor with a natural transformation between identity functor and itself.

(flabby sheaf: all of the restriction of the sheaf is surjective.)

## Adapted class

### Left-exact case

Given an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ and a left-exact functor $\mathcal{F}$ from $\mathcal{A}$, 

a class of objects $\mathcal{R} \subset \mathcal{A}$ is adapted to $\mathcal{F}$ if it satisfies the followings:

> * stable under finite direct sums
> * $\mathcal{F}$ maps any acyclit complex in $\text{Kom}^+(\mathcal{R})$ into an acyclic complex.
> * any object from $\mathcal{A}$ is a subobject of an object from $\mathcal{R}$

* If $\mathcal{A}$ contains sufficiently many injective objects, then the class of all injective objects is an adapted to any left-exact functor from $\mathcal{A}$

### Right-exact case

Given an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ and a right-exact functor $\mathcal{F}$ from $\mathcal{A}$, 

a class of objects $\mathcal{R} \subset \mathcal{A}$ is adapted to $\mathcal{F}$ if it satisfies the followings:

> * stable under finite direct sums
> * $\mathcal{F}$ maps any acyclit complex in $\text{Kom}^-(\mathcal{R})$ into an acyclic complex.
> * any object from $\mathcal{A}$ is a __quotient__ of an object from $\mathcal{R}$

If $\mathcal{A}$ contains sufficiently many projective objects, then the class of all injective objects is an adapted to any left-exact functor from $\mathcal{A}$

## What to check

* the section functor with a given open set is _left-exact_. 

Especially, the global section functor is left-exact.

* Let $M$ be a manifold with a structured sheaf $\mathcal{O}_M: U \rightarrow \{$ smooth fcts on $U\}$. 

The sheaf $\mathcal{E}:U \rightarrow \{$ smooth serctions of $\rho$ on $U \}$ is an $\mathcal{O}_M$-modules.

Then the category of sheaves associated to a vector bundle are not form of __Abelian category__

Check that: $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}: (x,v) \rightarrow (x, xv)$ is an example for not being abaelian.

## Kernel/Cokernel Sheaf

__Proposition 1.5.4.__

Let $\mathcal{K},\mathcal{C}$ be a kernel, cokernel of a morphism between sheaves, $f: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}$.

Then, $\mathcal{K}$ becomes a sheaf, but $\mathcal{C}$ is not always a sheaf but a presheaf.

* Kernel of a morphism between sheaves becomes a sheaf

Let $U=\cup U_i$ and $s_i \in \mathcal{K(U_i)}$. There is an unique $s \in \mathcal{F}$ satisfying

$$
res_{U, U_i}(s) = s_i
$$ 

as $\mathcal{K}(U_i) \subset \mathcal{F}(U_i)$. 

To check that $s \in \mathcal{U}$, one need to show that $f(u)=0 \in \mathcal{G}$.

Since $^\forall i,\ s_i \in \mathcal{K}(U_i)$, $res_{U, U_i}(f(s)) = f(s_i) = 0$. 

And there is an unique section $t \in \mathcal{G}(U)$ such that 

$$
res_{U, U_i}(t) = f(s_i) = 0
$$

So, $f(s) = t$ is a zero section in $G(U)$, therefore, $s \in \mathcal{K}(U)$.

* Cokernel of a morphism between sheves becomes a presheaf, but not always becomes a sheaf.

[GM] introduces a counter example.

Considering $Y=\mathbb{C} \setminus 0$ with its structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_Y$ as a sheaf of holomorphic functions on $Y$.

for any point $y \in Y$, choose a neighborhood $N_y$. 

If $N_y$ contains $0$ then $\rm{dim}( \rm{coker}(f(N_y)) )=1$ but $0$ otherwise.

It means that glued section may not be unique in some large neighborhood containing $0$, so $\rm{coker}$ is a presheaf but not always sheaf.

## Global section functor is left-exact

__Proposition__ 

Let $0 \rightarrow \mathscr{A} \rightarrow \mathscr{B} \rightarrow \mathscr{C} \rightarrow 0$ is an exact sequence of abelian sheaves on $X$.

Then, $^\forall U$, open subset of $X$,

$$
0 \to \mathscr{A}(U) \to \mathscr{B}(U) \to \mathscr{C}(U) 
$$
is an __exact__ sequence of abelian groups.
