# Knot Calculation DB

- [ ] modify name of sage module -> _sage-on-wolfram_ would be suitable.

- [ ] write .json structure for knots (@ [_notion_](https://www.notion.so/Knot-DB-Wiki-8b252f7e8f364feba2992a16af9ce8d8)).

- [ ] construct _readMagmaIdeal_ function.

- [ ] check workflow of _vCompNormalize_ function(legacy)

- [ ] confim vCompoNormalization function for _magma_

- [ ] calculate ratio of max coefficients of symmetrized Riley polynomial of alternating eps seq (100, 200, ...), Is there any limit of it?

- [ ] relation beteween eps sequences of $S(\alpha, \beta)$ and $S(\alpha, \beta`)$

- [ ] find ORS-form-like related $V$'s by dividing $V(\alpha, \beta)$ by $V(\alpha', \beta')$ where $\alpha' < \alpha$.

- [ ] any conjecture of conway form of which reducible riley polynomial(or $V$).

- [ ] Check __C++__ system for calculation for polynomials(use __NTL__)

# Theoretical

- [ ] read(skim) _Introduction_ in [_Octahedral developing of knot complement I_](../../../todo/#further-readings)

- [ ] read the end of _Interoduction_ in [_Reidemeister torsion on character varieties_](../../../todo/#further-readings)
