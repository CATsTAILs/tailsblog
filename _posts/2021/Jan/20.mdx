## AT

[On Leibniz cohomology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06128)
> Jörg Feldvoss, Friedrich Wagemann 

> Leibniz analogue of Whitehead's vanishing theorem
> Vanishing Theorem (Ref. COHOMOLOGY THEORY OF LIE GROUPS AND LIE ALGEBRAS)
> If $L$ is a semi-simple Lie algebra over a field of ch. $0$, with $P$, irreducible and nontrivial representation of $L$ then $H^q(L,P)=0$ for all dimensions $q$.

[Interleaving by parts for persistence in a poset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04366)
> Woojin Kim, Facundo Mémoli, Anastasios Stefanou

## DG

[Small eigenvalues of random 3-manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08031)
> Ursula Hamenstaedt, Gabriele Viaggi

> For every $g \geq 2$, there exists a number $c=c(g)>0$ such that the smallest positive eigenvalue of a random closed $3$-manifold $M$ of Heegard genus $g$ is at most $c(g)/vol(M)^2$.
> __Random manifold__
> A random Heegard splitting $M(w_n)$ is a $3$-manifold constructed by gluing two handlebodies together using a random walk of length $n$($w_n$ is a word representing it) as the gluing map.
> $w_n$ is a word in $G$, the mapping class group of the orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of the given manfiold.

[Inferring COVID-19 Biological Pathways from Clinical Phenotypes via Topological Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07417)
> Negin Karisani, Daniel E. Platt, Saugata Basu, Laxmi Parida

> unstructured notes -> phenotypes(symptoms, label(existence of disease)) find 'pathways' $:= \beta_1$ is not zero.
> pH with Vietoris-Rips complex is used.
> Dataset is provided from _Amazon Comprehend Medical_
> _Jaccard_ distance is used. A distance between two _sets_.
> $d(A,B)= 1 - \frac{|A \cap B}{A \cup B}$ 

[Determining Structural Properties of Artificial Neural Networks Using Algebraic Topology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07752)
> David Pérez Fernández, Asier Gutiérrez-Fandiño, Jordi Armengol-Estapé, Marta Villegas

> Weights are usually optimized according to the error function.
> Persistent homology on weights can effectively characterize ANN invariants : density(layers#, neurons#) / sample feeding order doesn't affect invariants.
> but different sub-problems(different labels?) affect those invariants(pH)
> used dataset : MNIST, CIFAR-10, Language identification Wikipedia dataset.
> used model : FCNN + Dropout
> new notions : Persistence landscape / Weighted silhouette / Heat vectorizations
> CONC : 1. __ Landscape discretization__ is not helpful for comparing PH diagrams associated to ANNs, _Heat_ and _silhouette_.
> Calculate topological distances among different structures. Network structure is represented as weighted graph. Authors take pH on those graphs.

# TODO

- [ ] Make more models :D

- [ ] Do some experiments with sound data (feature extracting first?)

- [ ] Autoencoder / how about reading '12 automatic ecg blah blah'

- [ ] Augmentation on training set

- [ ] Read [_Evolution of unknotting strategies for knots and braids_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0787)

- [ ] 1st chapter of Rolfsen's book

- [ ] 1st chapter of Wall's book

- [ ] Cnt comp 생각해보기

- [ ] Recurrence plot?

- [x] Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot? Because there is _continuous_ homotopy between  them

- [x] Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot? (False, what the author want to say is just there is an another embedding for being unknot (by def.))

- [ ] Read Ch2. of the thesis written by Kingma

- [ ] stability condition reading

- [ ] Marching cube code 살펴보기

- [ ] CT dcm investigation (necessary?)

- [ ] Diagram drawing 코드 분석(command only, 실행이라도 시켜보기)
