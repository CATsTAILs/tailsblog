# How to install phcpy

1. Install __gnat__ (not installed in ubuntu 16.04)
```bash
# sudo apt-get install gnat  # doesn't work
# sudo apt-get install gnat-4.9  # doesn't work (absent file:libgnat_pic.a / libgnarl_pic.a)
# # Download bin file from the official page, http://libre.adacore.com/ by wget
# chmoad +x path_to_the_bin_file  # doesn't work on the server, it needs to be displayed.
sudo apt-get install gnat-9  # Install the newest version which can be installed in your OS.
```

2. Install QDlib

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scibuilder/QD.git  # Install QDlib

cd QD

./configure CXX=/usr/bin/g++ CXXFLAGS='-fPIC -O3'

sudo make install
```

3. Install phcpy
```bash
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/janverschelde/PHCpack.git  # Install phc source codes

cd PHCpack/src/Objects

# # Do not use the below command line : may occur errors in the following steps 
# make phc  # To test errors? it will generate an executable file which is not used for phcpy. It spent too long time...(several minutes)
```

4. Modify variables in make_unix in _Objects_ folder

* PYTHON3 variable should indicate a folder containing __Python3.h__.
> There is no need to modify __PYTHON__ variable(a variable for python2)
> PYTHON3=/home/philip94/SageMath/local/include/python3.7m

* ADALIB variable should be indicate a folder named adalib (in a gcc folder, check example in the makefile_unix file)
> ADALIB = /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/adalib

* SAGEPYTHONLIB variable should be indicate a folder installed SageMath .. but it won't be used.
> SAGEPYTHONLIB=/home/philip94/SageMath/local/lib
If it doesn't exist, you may need to install development version of python3.

5. Compile the maine library
```bash
sudo make phcpy2c3.so  # In Obejects folder.
```

6. Install phcpy module in sage-python
```bash
cd ../Python/PHCpy
sage -python setup.py install
sage -python setup.py build
```

7. Import phcpy
```bash
sage -python
```
```python
# In python(sage) interpreter
import phcpy
>>> PHCv2.4.83 released 2020-12-15 works!
```

# Persistent Intersection Homology
> John Harer, Paul Bendich

오늘은 맛보기만

## 0. Abstract

Intersection theory with persistent homology. Poincaré duality is also used.

## 1. Introduction

__pH__ has been developed for a long time, and it contains Poincaré duality, Lefschetz duality, MV-sequence(2008) and Morse theory(2003).

$\phi$-persistence for an arbitrary chosen binary function $\phi$, which represents the simplex removal procedure.

A key fact: Intersection homolog porovides Poincaré duality for stratified space.(fails for ordinary homology)

and it mirrors to (persistent) homology on an embeddedn and filtered manifold.

## 2. Results

Applications:

1. Define an elevation function on an embedded 2-manifold, critical points = "pockets" $\rightarrow$ protein-dockings, protein-protein interface surface.

2. Manifold Learning; the analysis of high-dimensional data(point cloud). data cloud make manifold which data points are living on? ... maybe not(not constant dim.) but there is no reason not to consider manifold data case.

Let $K^i = K^{i-1}\cup_{\partial \sigma}\sigma_i$ and $\sigma_i$ is a $r$-dimensional simplex. Then, by using Mayer-Vietoris sequence for $K^i$, one can verify only $\beta_r^i$ or $\beta_{r-1}^i$ will vary compared to $\beta_*^{i-1}$.

## 3. Preliminaries

When one consider __Extended persistent diagram__, there is a symmetry in the diagram. one of ordinary pairs and the other of extended pairs(from relative homology). 

The symmetry induced from the fact that the datacloud is a manifold + the results of Poincaré duality.

Let $X$ be a $d$-manifold with a function $f$ having $n$ critical points. then for $0 \leq i, j \leq 2n, 0 \leq r \leq d$ there is a_perfect_ pairing
$$
P^{i,j}_r \otimes P^{2n-j+1, 2n-i+1}_{d-r} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}
$$

a bilinear pairing $\Gamma: U \otimes V \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ for $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ vector spaces $U$ and $V$ is called perfect if for every non zero $u \in U$, there exists $v_u \in V$ such that $\Gamma(u, v_u) = 1$ and vice versa.

In this settings, transverserly intersecting representatives of two homological classes are found, then, the number of intersection points modulo $2$ is calculated.

In the step for reducing boudnary matrices, lowest-one of $j$th column $=i$ implies that $\sigma_i$ and $\sigma_j$ is paired in the sense of pairing.

## 4. $\phi$-homology

Given a simplicial complex $K$, let $\phi:K \rightarrow {0,1}$ be a function on the simplices of $K$.

If $\phi(\sigma)=1$, then we say $\sigma$ is _proper_ simplex, _improper_ otherwise.

Let $P(K)$ be a set of proper simplices, and $P_i(K)$ be the $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ vector space with basis the proper $i$-dimensional proper simplices.

Before replacing chain complex $C_*(K)$ into $P_i(K)$, let's define _allowable_ chain for elements of $C_*(K)$.

a chain $\xi$ is called _allowable_ if $\xi$ and $\partial\xi$ both can be written as sums of proper simplices.

The set of all $i$ dimensional allowable chains forms $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-vector space $I^{\phi}C_i(K)$.

Futhermore, $\{I^{\phi}C_i(K)\}$ forms a chain complex since boundary of an allowable chain is an allowable chain, differential is induced from the previous chain complex.

Therefore, one can define $i$-th homology group of this chain complex, $I^{\phi}H_i(K)$ and also, $i$-th persistent homology group of it, $I^{\phi}H_r^i(K) = I^{\phi}H_r(K^i)$.

__Difference:__ the interpretation of _lowest-one_ function and the ordering of simplices in the columns and rows of boundary matrices.

We can no longer partition simplices into _postive_(generator) and _negative_(degenerator) since the 3rd category, _neutral_ occurs.

Let For a chain $\gamma \in P_i(K)$, let $I(\gamma)$ be the set of improper simplices in $\partial\gamma$.

Suppose there is a complex so far, $L$, and one tries to add a proper $i$-dimensional simplex $\sigma$. Then the one situation of the following three will occur.

1 There exits $\gamma \in P_i(K)$ such that $I(\gamma) = I(\sigma)$, __i.e.__ $\alpha = \gamma + \sigma$ is allowable chain.

ㄴa $\partial\alpha$ was not the boundary of $P_i(L)$, then $\alpha$ kills one dimension of $I^{\phi}H_{i-1}(L)$. $\sigma$ is called _negative_ in this case.

ㄴb $\partial\alpha$ was already the boudary of an element in $P_i(L)$, then it generates one dimension in $I^{\phi}H_{i}(L)$.  $\sigma$ is called _positive_ in this case.

2 Otherwise, $\sigma$ cannot make any new allowable chains, $\sigma$ is called _neutral_.

When $\sigma$ is negative or positive, then it is called an _active_ simplex.

### How to calculate $\phi$-homology?

__Reorder__ simplices in 0.positive first, 1.filtration and 2.dimension. 

Let $s=|P(K)|$ and $m=|K|$, so the number of improper simplices is $m-s$, then imagine boundary matrix without improper columns. So the boundary map is represented by $m \times s$ matrix.

Interpretation is the following.

* $\text{low}_R(j) = 0$: $\sigma_j$ is positive(and active).

* $\text{low}_R(j) = i \leq s$: $\sigma_j$ is positive(and negative) and paired with $\sigma_i$.

* $\text{low}_R(j) = k \gt s$: $\sigma_j$ is neutral.

Q. How to calculate betti numbers? 

A. Just count lowest-ones whose values are above first $s$ rows!

## 5. Stratified Spaces

Stratified spaces : The intersection homology theory can be defined naturally on these spaces.

It has so many alternative definitions. cf) [Surgery and stratified spaces](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00009-013-0332-7)

Stratified space is a topological space which can be decomposed into pieces of manifolds possibly with different dimensions.

__Definition__

A $d$-dimension topological stratified space is a (paracompact and Hausdorff) topological spsace $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ together with a descending chain of closed subsets.
$$
X = X_d \supseteq X_{d-1} \supseteq \cdots X_0 \supseteq X_{-1} = \emptyset
$$
so that $X_d - X_{d-1}$ is dense in $X$ with the following property:
For each $x \in X_i \setminus X_{i-1}$, there is a compact topologically stratified space $V_x$
$$
V_x = V_d \supseteq V_{d-1} \supseteq \cdots \supseteq V_i = \{\text{point}\}
$$
where $V_{k} \setminus V_{k-1}$ has dimension $i-k$, and a map $\psi_x: B^i \times V_d \rightarrow X$.

such  that $B^i \times V_k$ maps homeomorphically onto closed neighborhoods of $x in X_k$ $\forall k \geq in$, $B^i$ is a closed $d$-dimensional ball.
