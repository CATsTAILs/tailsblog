# phcpy 

1. phcpy modulization을 위한 함수 다듬기(옵션이랑 싸우는 중) - phcpySolve 에서의 옵션 컨트롤 Checked.

2. 정확도 확인

3. 1-dim일 때의 결과 분석(factor.solve)


# Want to do 

* Knot drawing program 분석(Theoretical?)

* PCG Segmentation 알아보기

* 해당 분야의 배경지식 없이 인자 사이의 관련성을 찾는 것이 가능할까? / 배경지식 없이 행할 수 있는 모든 분석 -> 통계적인 방법을 배워야할까보다

* Data with uncertainty

# TODO

- [ ] Make more models :D

- [ ] Do some experiments with sound data (feature extracting first?)

- [ ] Autoencoder / how about reading '12 automatic ecg blah blah'

- [ ] Augmentation on training set

- [ ] Read [_Evolution of unknotting strategies for knots and braids_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0787)

- [ ] 1st chapter of Rolfsen's book

- [ ] 1st chapter of Wall's book

- [ ] Cnt comp 생각해보기

- [ ] Recurrence plot?

- [x] Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot? Because there is _continuous_ homotopy between  them

- [x] Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot? (False, what the author want to say is just there is an another embedding for being unknot (by def.))

- [ ] Read Ch2. of the thesis written by Kingma

- [ ] stability condition reading

- [ ] Marching cube code 살펴보기

- [ ] CT dcm investigation (necessary?)

- [ ] Diagram drawing 코드 분석(command only, 실행이라도 시켜보기)

- [ ] PrimeDecomposition 원리 분석

- [ ] Sphere packing algorithm
