# Torsions

Riemann-Roch -> Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch -> Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch

Hauptvermutung(_main conjecture_ in German)

* For a given triangulable space with two different triangulations, do they have the common subdivisions that are combinatorically equivalent?
> The non-manifold version was disproved by __John Milnor__ in 1961 using Reidemeister torsion.

$K_1$ : introduced in (topological)$K$-theory. It is defined using vector bundles on a _suspension_ of the space

# Persistence Torsions?

Otto say: cup product on the cohomology would be more promising than torsion.

* Support 1. It is more interpretable, there are intuitions about prodcut structure, but few for torsion. (Did you calculate torsions?) Especially, notions for _intersection_ are related.

* Support 2. Shorter huddle. even Hatcher explaind cup product (without intersection things) but not torsion.

Quantum product(product in symplectic (co)homology) exists but it might not be directly applied to the persistence settings.

There are relations on units in cohomology and continuation.

In torus example, you notice that filtration level and dimension of cohomology should be considered simultaneously.


# Want to do 

* How about __Persistence Torsion__? or .. __Persistence Product__!?

* Experimental Mathematics 논문들 살펴보기

* Knot drawing program 분석(Theoretical?)

* PCG Segmentation 알아보기 -> CinC2016 with MatLab

* 해당 분야의 배경지식 없이 인자 사이의 관련성을 찾는 것이 가능할까? / 배경지식 없이 행할 수 있는 모든 분석 -> 통계적인 방법을 배워야할까보다

* Discrete component is just a high probablisitc distribution?

* Data with uncertainty

# TODO

- [ ] Make more models :D

- [ ] Do some experiments with sound data (feature extracting first?)

- [ ] Autoencoder / how about reading '12 automatic ecg blah blah'

- [ ] Augmentation on training set

- [ ] Read [_Evolution of unknotting strategies for knots and braids_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0787)

- [ ] 1st chapter of Rolfsen's book

- [ ] 1st chapter of Wall's book

- [ ] Cnt comp 생각해보기

- [ ] Recurrence plot?

- [x] Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot? Because there is _continuous_ homotopy between  them

- [x] Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot? (False, what the author want to say is just there is an another embedding for being unknot (by def.))

- [ ] Read Ch2. of the thesis written by Kingma

- [ ] stability condition reading

- [ ] Marching cube code 살펴보기

- [ ] CT dcm investigation (necessary?)

- [ ] Diagram drawing 코드 분석(command only, 실행이라도 시켜보기)

- [ ] PrimeDecomposition 원리 분석

- [ ] Sphere packing algorithm
