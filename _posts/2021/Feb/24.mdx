> A topological condition for a generic sliced space to be globally hyperbolic.

A __sliced space__ is consists of $(n+1)$ dimensional smooth manifold $M \times I$ where $M$ is a $n$ dimensional smooth manifold and an interval(open / closed any?) of the real line$(\mathbb{R})$ with $(n+1)$ dimensional _Lorentz_ metric which splits as follows:
$$
g = -N^2(\theta^0)^2 + g_{ij}\theta^i \theta^j
$$
where $\theta^0 = dt$, $\theta^i = dx^i + \beta^i dt$, $N=N(t, x^i)$ is the _lapse function_, $\beta^i(t, x^j)$ is the _shift function_ and $M_t = V \times {t}$, spatial slices of $V$ are spacelike manifolds with time-dependent metric $g_t = g_{ij}dx^idx^j$.

In the _Cotaskis_' paper, the condition for being globally hyperbolic is described with hypothesis that uniformly boundedness for _lapse_, _shift_, and _spatial metric_, with more details,

__THM__(Cotsakis)
Let $(V, g)$ be a sliced space with uniformly bounded lapse $N$, shift $\beta$ and spatial metric $g_t$. Then, the following are equivalent.

__1__ $(M_0, \gamma)$ is a complete Riemannian manifold.

__2__ The spacetime $(V, g)$ is _globally hyperbolic_.

In this article, the review of global hyperbolicity is described in terms of the product topology of $M \times \mathbb{R}$ for some finite-dimensional manifold $M$.

[On the Smale Conjecture for Diff(S4)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07269)
> Selman Akbulut

> Differnet proof _Watanabe_'s proof from of _Smale_ conjecture for $S^4$.

Recently, _Watanabe_(2018) disproved _Smale_'s conjecture for $S^4$ by showing $\text{Diff}(S^4) \neq \text{SO}(5)$(SO($5$)? O($5$)?. He showed this by proving higher homotopy groups of them are different.
This paper prove the same statement by showoing $\pi_0(\text{Diff}(S^4)) \neq 0$.

___Smale_'s conjecture__

The diffeomorphism group of $3$-spheres has the same homotopy type of its isometry group, the orthogonal group $O(4)$.

This conjecture is proved by _Allan Hatcher_(1983), and it has long been known that this fails for higher dimensions at least $5$.

And for dimension $4$, _Watanabe_ disproved in ($2018$)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02448].

There are equivalent statements($3$-dim).

__1__ the component of the unknot in the space of smooth embeddings of the circle in $3$-sphere has the homotopy type of the round circles, __i.e.__ $\text{O}(3)$.

__2__ the diffeomorphism group of the $3$-ball restricted to the identity on its boundary is contractible.

Stability theorem for $2$-parameter persistent homology, stability($\pm$outliers) for several bifiltration constructions are shown.

["Not just an idle game":(examining some historical conceptual arguments in homotopy theory)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00534)
>  Ronald Brown

From the first definition of higher homotopy by __Céch__(1932).

The title is a quote taken from __Einstein__'s writing. He and the author worried about missing basic questions of some concepts in question nowadays.

__i.e.__ This paper is written to understand historical traces in _homotopy theory_.

[A free-group valued invariant of free knots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15571)
> Vassily Olegovich Manturov

> To construct invariants for free knots(flat virtual knots, virtual knots) valued in free groups(and free prodcut of cyclic groups)

Knots $=$ Gauss diagrams/Reidemeister moves

Classical knots : Gauss diagrams are drawn in plane, __i.e.__ there is some restriction called _planarity_.

Virtual knots : Let's forget planarity for generalization!

How to encode Gauss diagram?

__1__ Use two bits of information, _local writhe_ and _over_ to _under_(crossings)

__2__ Use $1$-component framed $4$-valent graphs.

__Long free knot__ : In terms of __2__, breaking the $4$-valent graph in a point, and pulling the two ends to the infinity. Moves over the _infinity_ is not allowed in this case.

Advantage of it : _reference point_?

__NOTE:__ Cannot read further since I cannot get the difference between _free knots_ and _long free knots_.

[Optimizing persistent homology based functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08356)
> Mathieu Carrière, Frédéric Chazal, Marc Glisse, Yuichi Ike, Hariprasad Kannan

Differenctiablity of a general map associated with the persistence map, building on real analytic geometry arguments, authors propose a code to calculate gradients of it.

and they provide also conditions for convergence of stochastic subgradient method

_persistence map_ can be thought as a map between Euclidean space -> it is semi-algebraic(arguments from _o-minimal_ geometry(terms related to model CAT..))

persistence map is nothing but permutation of the coordinates of a vector containing the filtration values.

For a given simplicial complex $K$ and filtration(compatible to the complex) $\Phi:K \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ on it, then its vectorized filtration $\Phi = (\Phi_\sigma)_{\sigma \in K}$ can be defined as a $|K|$-dimensional vector in $\mathbb{R}^{|K|}$.

by the compatiblity, if $\tau \subset \sigma$ then $\Phi_\tau \leq \Phi_\sigma$.

If the $\Phi$ depends on a parameter, then the corresponding family of filtrations can be represented as a map from the space of parameters to $\mathbb{R}^{|K|}$.

__i.e.__ $\Phi: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{|K|}$ for a set $A$.

__o-minimal structure__ on $\mathbb{R}$ is a collection $(S_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ where each $S_n$ is a set of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ such thatn

__1__ $S_1$ = the collection of finite unions of points and intervals

__2__ all algebraic subsets(any $0$ sets of polynomials) of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are in $S_n$

__3__ $S_n$ is a _Boolean subalgebra_(=subalgebra) of $\mathbb{R}^n$ for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$

__4__ If $A \in S_n$ and $B \in S_m$ then $A \times B \in S_{n+m}$

__5__ If $\pi:\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is the projection to the first $n$ coordinates, and $A \in S_{n+1}$, then $\pi(A) \in S_n$

An element in $S_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is called _definable set_. 

For a definable set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^N$, a map $f:A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ is _definable_ if its graph is definable set in $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$.

Thoese _definable sets_ are stable under geometric oprations, complement, closure, interior, finite union/intersection, image, sums, products, compositions ...

In particular, max and min of finite sets of real valued definable maps are also definable function.

And they admits _finite Whitney stratification_(what is it?). It implies that:

__1__ For any definable set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ can be decomposed into a finite disjoint union of smooth submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

__2__ For any definable map $\Phi:A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$, $A$ can be decomposed into a finite union of smooth manifolds such that the restriction of $\Phi$ to each of these manifolds is a differentiable function.

__Example__ : semi-algebraic subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n(n \in \mathbb{N})$.

Most of classical parametrized families of filtrations are semi-algebraic, but exponential functions are also allowed.[Wil96]

# Short notes for persistent homology

## Lecture notes for multiparameter persistent homology (Michael Lesnick)

Stable under the perturbation, but still highly sensitive to noise and outliers.

How to define multiparameter pH?

$$ M_{i,j} = H_l(\text{VR}_{\epsilon_i}(f^{-1}([\delta_j, \infty)))$$

for $l$ dimensional pH.

It is well-defined since any complex in $\text{VR}_{\epsilon_i}(f^{-1}([\delta_j, \infty))$ is in $\text{VR}_{\epsilon_{i'}}(f^{-1}([\delta_{j'}, \infty))$ by inclusion.

__NOTE__: But it is not decomposed as intervels like $1d$ cases... Apparently, it is decomposed as indecomposable modules, but hard to find an way to expression of it, __i.e.__ parametrization of them.


### RIVET (Rank Invariant Visualization and Exploration Tool)

The ideal of __RIVET__ is, restrict multidimension persistent modules to an arbitrary straight line $L$ which have non-negative slope.

$M|L$ can be calculated fast with the algorithm of it using some commutative algebra tools.

* Hall's theorem -> stability of bottleneck distance can be proved.

__TEST__ 

Test is done by dataset given by authors of RIVET.

__1__ 210pts on a square, with homology degree 0. fast! fancy! easy to use!

__2__ 450pts on a square, with homology degree 2. It crashes.

__3__ 450pts on a square, with homology degree 1. It doesn't crash but took several miniutes.

## Idea

__1__ How about a sum of probablity distribution instead of complexes(like VR)?

__2__ Uniform sampling on manifold by parametrizated space

__3__ _Something_ can lie to the observer..
