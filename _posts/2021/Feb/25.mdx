[The Persistent Homology of Dual Digital Image Constructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11397)
> Bea Bleile, Adélie Garin, Teresa Heiss, Kelly Maggs, Vanessa Robins

Persistent homology of grayscale digital images.

There are methods commonly used for constructing a cubical complex for images, based on direct / indirect digital adjacencies.

pH from those has no common results.

and the resulting complexes show some duality of themselves, from this, authors derive kind of combined complex, namely, dual filtered cell complexes.

They researched relationship between pH of two dual filtered cell complexes. and application to digital images.

A method to convert pH from one dual filtered cell complexes to the other dual filtered cell complexes are included.

__direct/indirect connectivity__

Direct : two _voxels_ are connected whenever coordinates of their location differ by only $1$ e.g. $(2,4)$ and $(2,3)$, connectivity diagonally is not allowed.

Indirect : two _voxles_ are connected in direct way or in diagonally.

So, for $d$-dimensional images, there are $2d$ ways of direct connectivity and $3^d - 1$ ways of indirect conenctivity(way to count the number of voxels in cubes whose edges have length 3).

# pH

Chazal et al. introduced $\epsilon$-interleaving in $2019$.

Interleaving distance, $d_i$ is stable with respect to $|| \cdot ||$ distance. 

__i.e.__ $d_i(H_*(\mathcal{F}), H_*(\mathcal{G})) \leq ||f, g||_{\infty}$.

# TODO

- [ ] Make more models :D

- [ ] Do some experiments with sound data (feature extracting first?)

- [ ] Autoencoder / how about reading '12 automatic ecg blah blah'

- [ ] Augmentation on training set

- [ ] Read [_Evolution of unknotting strategies for knots and braids_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0787)

- [x] 1st chapter of Rolfsen's book

- [ ] 1st chapter of Wall's book

- [ ] Cnt comp 생각해보기

- [ ] Recurrence plot?

- [x] Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot? Because there is _continuous_ homotopy between  them

- [x] Why any knot embedded in $S^3$ is homotoped to unknot? (False, what the author want to say is just there is an another embedding for being unknot (by def.))

- [ ] Read Ch2. of the thesis written by Kingma

- [ ] stability condition reading

- [ ] Marching cube code 살펴보기

- [ ] CT dcm investigation (necessary?)

- [ ] Diagram drawing 코드 분석(command only, 실행이라도 시켜보기)

- [ ] PrimeDecomposition 원리 분석

- [ ] Sphere packing algorithm
