[N-quandles of links](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15478)
> Blake Mellor, Riley Smith

Every kriented knot and link $L$ has a fundamental quandle $Q(L)$, it is a complete invariant up to a change of orientation for tame knots(Joyce and Matveev).

As you expected, however, classifying quandles is no easier than classifying knots.

__e.g.__ The unknot / Hopf link $\rightarrow$ $Q(L)$ is infinite.

But at leas, quandles of knot / link are _residually finite_.

__Residually finite__

> A group is _residually finite_ or _finitely approximable_ if for every element $g \neq \text{id} \in G$,
>
> there is a homomorphism $h$ for $G$ to a finite group such that $h(g) \neq 1$.

So, any pair of elements are distinguished by _some_ finite quotient. $\rightarrow$ Study of (finite) quotient quandles.

Ex) $n$-quandle (Joyce)

Hoste and Shanahan proved that the $n$-quandle $Q_n(L)$ is finite iff $L$ is the singular locus(with each component labeled $n$?!) of a spherical $3$-orbifold with underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3$.

with Dunbar's classification of all geometric, non-hyperbolic, $3$-orbitfolds, allowed them to give a complete list of all knots/links in $\mathbb{S}^3$ with finite $n$-quandles for some $n$.

The point is, Dunbar's classification also includes orbifolds whose singular locus is a link with diff. labels on diff. components $\rightarrow$ generalizable! ($N$-quandle where $N=(n_1, \cdots, n_k)$, $k$ is the number of components.)

__i.e.__ Main conjecture is,

A link $L$ with $k$ copmoentns has a finite $(n_1, \cdots, n_k)$-quandle iff

there is a spherical orbifold with underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3$ whose singular locus is $L$, with component $i$ labeled $n_i$.

And authors proved that $N$-quandle is an invariant of isotopy with half proof of the main conjecture:

If there is a spherical orbifold with underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3$ whose singular locus is $L$, with component $i$ labeled $n_i$, then the $(n_1, \cdots, n_k)$-quandle of $L$ is finite.

A _quandle_ is a set $Q$ equipped with two binary operations $\rhd$ and $\rhd^{-1}$ with $3$ following axioms.

__A1.__ $x \rhd x = x$ for all $x \in Q$.

__A2.__ $(x \rhd y) \rhd^{-1} y = x = (x \rhd^{-1} y) \rhd y$ for all $x,y \in Q$.

__A3.__ $(x \rhd y) \rhd z = (x \rhd z) \rhd (y \rhd z)$ for all $x,y,z \in$ Q.

Then the _point symmetry at_ $x$, $S_x: Q \rightarrow Q$ by $S_x(y) = y \rhd x$ become bijection(__A2.__) quandle homomorphism(__A3.__).

__Notations:__ $a^b := a \rhd b$, $a^{\hat{b}} = a \rhd^{-1} b$, $a^{bc} = (a \rhd b) \rhd c$, $a^{b^c} = a \rhd (b \rhd c)$. In general, $\rhd,\rhd{-1}$ is not associative.

[The Twist Subgroup is generated by two elements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10483)
> Tulin Altunoz, Mehmetcik Pamuk, Oguz Yildiz

The twist subgroup $\mathcal{T}_g$ of a nonorientable surface of genus $g$ can be generated by two elements for every odd $g \geq 27$ and even $g \geq 42$.

The mapping class group $Mod(N_g)$ of a closed connected non-orientable surface of genus $g$, $N_g$ is less studied than the group of an orientable surface.

It is defined as the group of the isotopy classes of all self-diffeomorphisms of $N_g$.

A simple closed curve on $N_g$ is called _one-sided_ if a regular neighbourhood of it is homeomorphic to a Möbius band.

It is called _two-sided_  if it is homemorphic to an annulus.

For a  two-sided curve $a$, the Dehn twist $t_a$ can be dfined.

Fix one of two possible orientations on a regular neighbourhood of $a$. Denote the right-handed Dehn twist $t_a$ about $a$ by $A$.

basic properties of Dehn twists:

__1__ __Commutativity__ If $a$ and $b$ are disjoint, $AB = BA$

__2__ __Conjugation__ If $f(a)=b$, then $f A f^{-1}  = B^s$ where $s = \pm 1$ depending on the orientation preservingness of $f$.

[Shifting chain maps in quandle homology and cocycle invariants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09584)
> Yu Hashimoto, Kokoro Tanaka

_Qunadles_' axioms encode the movements of oriented classical links in $\mathbb{R}^3$ through their diagrams in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

They turn out to be also useful for studying oriented surface links in $\mathbb{R}^4$ throgh their diagrams in  $\mathbb{R}^3$.

As a basic link invariants,there is a _coloring numbers_.

And, as enhancements of it, there are _quandle cocycle invariants_ and _shadow cocycle invariants_ by using quandle homology theory.

Chain complex consists of quandle $n$-cocycles, for a given quandle $(X,*)$ and an abelian group $A$, a map from $X^n$ to $A$ satisfying some conditions.

_some conditions_ is defined by defining boundary map $\partial_n$ where  $C^R_n(X)$ is a free abelian group generated by $X^n$ for positive $n$. ($0$ otherwise)

Define two homomorphisms $\partial^0_n, \partial^1_n:C^R_n(X) \rightarrow C^R_{n-1}(X)$ by
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
& \displaystyle \partial^0_n(x_1, \cdots, x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^i(x_1, \cdots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \cdots, x_n) \\
& \displaystyle \partial^1_n(x_1, \cdots, x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^i(x_1*x_i, \cdots, x_{i-1}*x_i, x_{i+1}, \cdots, x_n)
\end{array}
$$

Then homomorphisms satisfying:
$$
\partial^0_{n-1} \circ \partial^0_n = 0, \partial^1_{n-1} \circ \partial^1_n = 0, \partial^1_{n-1} \circ \partial^0_{n} + \partial^0_{n-1} \circ \partial^1_n = 0
$$

By letting $\partial_n = \partial_n^0 - \partial_n^1$, One can get a chain complex $C_*^R = (C_n^R(X), \partial_n)$.

Nature's morphology from the perspective of non-Euclidean plate theory.

Identifying a novel type of defect and a branch-point of teh normal map $\rightarrow$ the generation of such complex wrinkling patterns in thin elastic hyperbolic surfaces, even in the absence of stretching.

thoes branch points: the natural defects in hyperbolic sheets, and they carry a topological charge which gives them a degree of robustness.

also, they can infludence the overall morphology of a hyperbolic surface w/o concentrating elastic energy.

authors developed a theory for branch poitns and investigated their role in determining the mechanical response of hyperbolic sheetes to weak external forces.

[Lie algebroids are curved Lie algebras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10728)
> Damien Calaque, Ricardo Campos, Joost Nuiten

__Curved Lie algebras__

graded Lie algebras with a differential that does not square to zero, but whose square is controlled by a curvature element: $d^2 = [\theta, -]$

it corresponds to the geometric objects without a fixed basepoint!, Kontsevich considered formal graded pointed $Q$-manifolds, which are equivalenet to $L_\infty-algebras$. (unpointed : curved $L_\infty$-algebras)

[Kac-Rice formula for transverse intersections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10853)
> Michele Stecconi

The interest in studying the expected number of realizations of a geometric condition! (stochastic geom & geom. prob. / useful for enum. geo., physics)

Let us consider a random $\mathcal{C}^1$ function $X: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ where $M \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ is an open subset.

Then, under appropriate assumptions on $X$, we have the _Kac-Rice formula_ for the expected cardinality of the set of solutions of the equation $X=t$ for $t \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
$$
\displaystyle \mathbb{E}(\# X^{-1}(t)) = \int_M \mathbb{E}\{|\det(d_uX)| \mid X(u)=t \}\rho_{X(u)}(t)du
$$
where $\rho_{X(u)}$ is the density of the random variable $X(u)$, meaning that for every event $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, we have $\mathbb{P}\{ X(u) \in A \} = \int_A \rho_{X(u)}(t)dt$.

it is appeared in the independent works by M. Kac and S. O. Rice at first, but became one of the most important tool in the application of smooth stochastic processes(here called _random maps_ or _random fields_) both pure in applied maths.

[Infinity-operads and Day convolution in Goodwillie calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03467)
> Michael Ching

__Goodwillie__ calculus

Construction:

for a functor $F:\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$, a tower of approximations to $F$ tat mimics the Taylor series in ordinary calculus.

One of the basic principles of this theory is that the fibres of the maps in that tower can be described relatively simply in terms of stable homotopy theory.

Goodwillie showed that when $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ are either the categories of pointed spaces or spectra, the $n$th homogeneous pices of a functor $F$ is determined by a single spectrum $\partial_n F$ together with an action of the $n$th symmetric group $\Sigma_n$.

[Representations of Energy Landscapes by Sublevelset Persistent Homology: An Example With n-Alkanes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00918)
> Joshua Mirth, Yanqin Zhai, Johnathan Bush, Enrique G Alvarado, Howie Jordan, Mark Heim, Bala Krishnamoorthy, Markus Pflaum, Aurora Clark, Y Z, Henry Adams

(APPLICATION TO CHEMISTRY!!!)

The topology of each connected component at different energy thresholds must have more information than the connectivity of the local minima of an energy landscape via the lowest-barrier pathways.

So by using the tool, sublevelsts pH, let us gain information
