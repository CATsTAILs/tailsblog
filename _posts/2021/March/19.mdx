[Lower Bound for the Simplicial Volume of Closed Manifolds Covered by H2×H2×H2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09997)
> Jixiang Fu, Xiaofeng Meng

Estimation on the upper bound for the $l^{\infty}$-norm of the volume form on $\mathbb{H}^2 \times \mathbb{H}^2 \times \mathbb{H}^2$ .. seen as a class in $H_c^6(\text{PSL}_2\mathbb{R} \times \text{PSL}_2\mathbb{R} \times \text{PSL}_2\mathbb{R}; \mathbb{R})

From this, they got the lower bound for the simplicial volume of closed mfd. covered by $\mathbb{H}^2 \times \mathbb{H}^2 \times \mathbb{H}^2$.

The simplicial volume is a topological invariant of mfds introduced by Gromov & Thurston(that lecture note!)

__Simplicial Volume__

For an oriented closed connected $n$-dimensional manifold $M$, $H_n(M,\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by the fundamental class $[M]_\mathbb{Z}$ of $M$.

The image of $[M]_\mathbb{Z}$ via the change of coefficients map $H_n(M,\mathbb{Z}) \hookrightarrow H_n(M,\mathbb{R})$ by $[M] \in H_n(M,\mathbb{R})$.

Then the simplicial volume of $M$ is defined by
$$
\Vert M \Vert = \inf\{\sum_i \vert a_i \vert \mid [\sum_i a_i\sigma_i] = [M] \in H_n(M,\mathbb{R})\}
$$

( Is this really invariant?! )

For a non-orientable closed connected manifold $M$, the simplicial volume is defined by $\Vert \hat{M} \Vert/2$ where $\hat{M}$ is the oriented double covering of $M$.

"The exawct value of non-vanishing simplicial volume has only beern calculated for a few cases."

[Ideal triangles, hyperbolic surfaces and the Thurston metric on Teichm{ü}ller space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10066)
> Athanase Papadopoulos (IRMA, GREAM)

__Teichmüller space__, $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}(S)$

of $S$ is the set of isotopy classes of hyperbolic metrics on $S$.

$S$ is an oriented surface of finite topological type!

It is equipped with a topology which can be defined ... several ways.

One of ways:

Start the map from $\mathcal{T} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+^{\mathcal{S}}$ of positive functions on $\mathcal{S}$.

The map send $\gamma \mapsto l_g(\gamma)$ where $l_g(\gamma)$ denotes the length of the unique geodesic on $S$ representing the homotopy class $\gamma$ w.r.t. the hyperbolic metric $g$.

The map is injective.

!! a hyperbolic surface is determined by its marked simple length spectrum !!

The topology of $\mathcal{T}$ is induced on the image of this embedding by the weak topology on the space $\mathbb{R}_+^{\mathcal{S}}$.

This article seems to be easy to read!

[Combination Theorems in Groups, Geometry and Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10082)
> Mahan Mj, Sabyasachi Mukherjee

A survey of _combination theorems occurring in hyperbolic geometry_, _geometric group theory_ and _complex dynamics_. (Thurston's  contributuion/influence!)

__Combination theorems__

Start from Klein's  paper from 1883.

Combination theorems for Kleinian groups .. Maskit!

then Thurston's advent and his proof of hyperbolization of atoroidal Haken mfd.(doesn't contain an essential(incompressible, non-boundary parallel, embedded) torus + Haken)

Thurston gives profound influence on hyperbolic geometry and provide a template for related developments in geometric group theory and complex dynamics.

Bestvina and Feighn isolated the coarse geometric features of Thurston's combination theorem and proved a highly influential combination theorme for Gromov-hyperbolic groups and other things!

Recently, resolution of Thurston's virtual Haken conjecture (Agol(13) and Wise(21), combination theorem for virtually special cubulable hyperbolic groups(Haglund and Wise)

... and French?

[Twisted Milnor Hypersurface I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10208)
> Jingfang Lian, Fei Han, Hao Li, Zhi Lü

__Twisted Milnor Hypersurfaces__

Denoted by $H_{n_1, n_2}$, the Milnor hypersurface, which is the smooth hypersurface in $\mathbb{C}P^{n_1} \times \mathbb{C}P^{n_2}$, the product of two complex projective spaces, defined by the equation
$$
x_0 y_0 + \cdots + x_k y_k = 0, k= \min\{n_1,n_2\}
$$
where $[x_0 : x_1 : \cdots : x_{n_1}]$ and $[y_0 : y_1 : \cdots : y_{n_2}]$ are the homogeneous coordinates on $\mathbb{C}P^{n_1},\mathbb{C}P^{n_2}$ respectively.

Then $H_{n_1, n_2}$ is Poincaré dual to the cohomology class $u+v \in H^2(\mathbb{C}P^{n_1} \times \mathbb{C}P^{n_2})$, where $u$ and $v$ are the generators of $H^*(\mathbb{C}P^{n_1}, \mathbb{Z})$ and $H^*(\mathbb{C}P^{n_2}, \mathbb{Z})$ respectively.

well-known : the Milnor  hypersurfaces can be used as generators in the unitary bordism ring(a.k.a. complex bordism ring ..?) $\Omega^U$
