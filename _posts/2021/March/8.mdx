[The Euler Characteristic: A General Topological Descriptor for Complex Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03144)
> Alexander Smith, Victor Zavala

Euler Characteristic as discriptor in application fields.

From filtration, EC curve is obtained.

In Geometry of random fields, EC encodes info. of simple stat. descriptors(mean, var, ..) of more complex descriptors. : conn. between geom. and stat.

EC curve: low-dim descriptors, simipler than persistence diagrams

Goal: applied perspective on the EC! (Fields: Brain monitoring, spatio-temporal behavior of fields, image analysis, point cloud analysis, )

[On strongly inflexible manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01961)
> Cristina Costoya, Vicente Muñoz, Antonio Viruel

_inflexible manifolds_?

An oriented cpt. conn. $n$-manifold $M$ is inflexible $\Longleftrightarrow$ it does not admit self-maps of unbounded degree. (all self-maps have bounded degree)

$+$ if all the maps from any other oriented cpt. conn. $n$-manifold have bounded degree, then $M$ is said to be _strongly inflexible_.

The existence of inflexible manifolds $\Leftarrow$ _Arkowitz_, _Lupton_.

_No example of simply-connected strongly inflexible manifold is known_.

How to check?: using _Sullivan_ models to check simply conn. mfd is strongly inflexible.

$+$ Simplicial volume is used to show that oriented closed connected hyperbolic manifolds are inflexible.

in fact, there exists example of inflexible manifolds with 0 or unknown simplicial volume.

[Tribracket Polynomials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02704)
> Sam Nelson, Fletcher Nickerson

Introducing $6$ variable polynomial invariant of _Niebrzydowski tribrackets_(analogous to qunadle/rack/biquandle polynomials)

_quandle polynomial_: $2$ variable polynomial invariant of finite quandles.

[Decomposition space theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02977)
> Boldizsar Kalmar

__Introduction to Decomposition theory, classicial/well-known results__

__Q__. If a partitioning/decomposition of topological space is given, what is the topology of the quotient space?

__Main Result__. _upper semi-continuous_ decomposition $\rightarrow$ a homeomorphic decomposition space if the decomposition is _shrinkable_(existence of self-homeomorphisms of the space which shrink the partitions into arb. small sets in a controllable way.); _Bing shrinkablity_ criterion.

[Ribbon 2-knot groups of Coxeter type](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01987)
> Jens Harlander, Stephan Rosebrock

Wirtinger presentations of deficiency $1$ $\leftarrow$ knots, long virtual knots, and ribbon $2$-knots.

And they are encoded by (word)labeled oriented trees, called _LOT_ presentations which is important testing ground for the validity/failure of Whitehead's asphericity conjecture.

A _(word) labeled oriented graph_ is an oriented finite graph $\Gamma$ on vertices $\mathbb{x}$ and edges $\mathbb{e}$ where each oriented edge is labeled by a workd in $\mathbb{x}^{\pm1}$.

Associated with a LOG $\Gamma$ presentation:
$$
P(\Gamma) = \langle\mathbb{x} |  \mathbb{r} = \{r_e | e \in \mathbb{e}\}\rangle
$$
where $r_e = xw(wy)^{-1}$ in case $e = (x \xrightarrow{w} y)$.

[Experimental Mathematics Approach to Gauss Diagrams Realizability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02102)
> A. Khan, A. Lisitsa, A. Vernitski

Is a _Gauss diagram_(achord diagram) __realizable__? i.e. does itcorresponds to a knot / an immersed curve?

First answer : $1930$s by Dehn, he found a suficient algorithmic solution based on the existence of a _touch Jordan curve_ which is the image of a transformation of the knot diagram by successive splits replacing all the crossings.

L. Lovasz and M.L. Marx in $1976$, found a second necessary condition

And the third condition which allowed the set of three conditions to be sufficient is found by r.C. Read and P. Rosenstiehl in the same year.

__The Gauss Diagram__

the immersing circle with the preimage of each double point connected with a __chord__.
