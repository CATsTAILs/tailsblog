[Spacetime distances: an exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01191)
> Carlos Vega

Difference between Lorentzian manifolds and Riemannian manifolds in the sense of _metrics_.

To model the universe, geometry is considered. Three questions are served.

__1__ : What is the distance between two points in a spacetime?

__2__ : What is the distance between two spacetimes?

__3__ : What is a _big bang_?

Loretzian can be Riemannianized by adding conditions, __e.g.__ Wick Rotation. but this method need a restriction that a time function $\tau$ should be smooth although cosmological time $\tau_c$ is usually not.

some progress is made by __Ralph Howard__.

null distance function$\hat{d}_\tau$(kind of time-traveling taxicap distance) has some casuality property.
$$
q \in J^+(p) \implies \hat{d}_\tau(p,q) = \tau(q) - \tau(p)
$$

This paper want to study Riemannianized and null distance functions.

[The Ruelle zeta function at zero for nearly hyperbolic 3-manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08558)
> Mihajlo Cekić, Semyon Dyatlov, Benjamin Küster, Gabriel P. Paternain

Generic conformal metric perterbation(cpt hyperblci $3$-mfd $\Sigma$ with Betti number $b_1$) -> the order of vanishing of the _Ruelle_ zeta function is $4-b_1$.

Hyperbolic case -> $4-2b_1$. It's an invariant for $2d$ cases in contrast.

[Hyperbolic 4-manifolds with perfect circle-valued Morse functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04997)
> Ludovico Battista, Bruno Martelli

Perfect circle-valued _Morse_ function : a Morse function $f:M \rightarrow S^1$ with only $|\chi(M)|(=2$ in this setting) critical points for finite-volume hyperbolic $4$-manifolds $M$.

There is an example where every generic circle-valued function is homotopic to perfect one.

$\implies$ the existence of infinitely many finite-volume(compact and cusped) hyperbolic $4$-manifolds $M$ having a handle decomposition with bounded numbers(Betti numberes $b1$ and $b3$,  and $\textrm{rk}(\pi_1(M)))$ of $1$ and $3$ handles.

In $3$-manifolds, there are many finite-volume hyperbolic $3$ manifolds $M$ that fiber over $S^1$.

On such manifolds, the surface fiber $\Sigma$ generates $\pi_1(\Sigma) \lhd \pi_1(M)$, also, determines a geometrically infinite covering $\tilde{M}  \rightarrow M$ diffeomorphic to $\Sigma \times \mathbb{R}$.

Every finite-volume hyperbolic $3$-manifold is finitely covered by $3$-manifolds fiber over $S^1$(_Agol_ and _Wise_, virtual Haken conjecture?)

Since existence of those fibration in $n$-dimension settings fails since generalized _Gauss_-_Bonnet_ theorem ensures that such fibrations and the given manifodls have dfferent _Euler_ characteristic(vanishing or not).

So the statement should be fix first,
$$
\text{Are there any finite-volume hyperbolic } n- \text{manifolds with perfect circle-valued Morse functions in all }n?
$$

And authors answered for the case of $n=4$

[Developable surfaces with prescribed boundary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01270)
> Maria Alberich-Carramiñana, Jaume Amorós, Franco Coltraro

A generic simple closed piecewise regular curve in a space can be the boundary of only finitely many developable surfaces with non vanishing mean curvature.

_Developable surface_ is a smooth surface with Gaussian curvature $0$, so locally isometric to a domain in the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$.

__Classic Thm__ for thoese surfaces.

A $C^3$ developable surface $S$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has an open subset which is ruled, with unit normal vector constant along each line of ruling but varying in a transverse direction.

Every connected components of its complement is contained in a plane.

[Cell Complex Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00743)
> Mustafa Hajij, Kyle Istvan, Ghada Zamzmi

__Cell Complexes Neural Networks__(CXNs) is proposed in this paper.

Using inter cellular message passing scheme on cell complexes = generalization of message passing scheme on graphs.

cell complex autoencoder, __cell2vec__ is proposed(gen. of node2vec).

As a (kind of) generalization of __GNN__, is it useful/meaningful?

[Persistent Homology and Graphs Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12926)
> Mustafa Hajij, Ghada Zamzmi, Xuanting Cai

Topologica invariant properties in a node graph representational embeddings using pH.

Authors define _unique persistence-based graph descriptor_.

About node graph representation, the _encoder_ is defined as followings:

Let $G(V, E)$ is a graph, An encoder on $G$ is a function _enc_:
$$
enc : V_G  \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d
$$
for some positive integer $d$.

with a decoder _dec_:
$$
dec : \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+
$$

The pair (_enc_, _dec_) is called a graph AutoEncoder on $G$.

[Gradient solitons on statistical manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13470)
> Adara M. Blaga, Bang-Yen Chen

__Statistical structure__ on a smooth manifold $M$ consists of a pseudo-Riemannian metric $g$ and a torsion-free affine connection $\nabla$ such that $\nabla g$ is a Codazzi tensor field.

For such manifold, the dual connection $\nabla^*$ of $\nabla$ with respect to $g$ is uniquely defined by (Levi-Civita?)
$$
X(g(Y,Z)) = g(\nabla_X Y, Z) + g(Y, \nabla^*_X, Z)
$$
for $X, Y, Z \in \mathfrak{X}$. The dualistic structure $(\nabla, \nabla^*)$ plays an important role in statistics.

### Conjectures and Problems

* Yamabe problem

Let $(M, g)$ be a closed smooth Riemannian manifold, then there exists positive(?) and smooth function $f$ on $M$ such that $f_*g$ has constant scalar curvature.

* Arnold-Givental conjecture

$M$:smooth manifold with a family of smooth hamiltonian functions $H_t \in C^{\infty}(M); 0 \leq t \leq 1$, Denote by $\phi_H$ the time-one map of the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field $X_{H_t}$ of $H_t$.

Let $L$ be a Lagrangian submanifold of $M$, invariant under some antisymplectic involution of $M$ with assumption that $L$ and $\phi_H(L)$ intersects transversally.

Then,
$$
|L \cap \phi_H(L)| \leq \sum_{k=0}^n b_k(L;\mathbb{Z}_2)
$$

[Persistent and Zigzag Homology: A Matrix Factorization Viewpoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10693)
> Gunnar Carlsson, Anjan Dwaraknath, Bradley J. Nelson

pH and zigzag homology can be calculated using factorizations of associated matrices.

The method is parallelizable!

Computational topology, usually computation is done on the cell complexes, is highly expensive.


_Contributions_

__1__ Homomorphisms on homology with field coefficients are implemented in software.

__2__ Sequential/Parallel algorithm for interval decomposition

__3__ Apply thoese methods on pH and zigzag homology

__4__ Speed up
