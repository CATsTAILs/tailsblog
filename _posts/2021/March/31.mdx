[Rectangular diagrams of surfaces: distinguishing Legendrian knots](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06366)
> Ivan Dynnikov, Maxim Prasolov

Rectangular digrams of surfaces is introduced in the previous paper of authors.

Any isotopy class of a surface in the three-sphere can be presented by a rectangular diagram

[Rectangular diagrams of surfaces: representability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03497)
> Ivan Dynnikov, Maxim Prasolov

A _rectangle_ in the $2$-torus $\mathbb{T} = \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1$ is a subset of the form $[\theta_1, \theta_2] \times [\phi_1, \phi_2]$

[Classical Poincar{é} conjecture via 4D topology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16001)
> Akio Kawauchi

Every homotopy $3$-sphere is diffeomorphic to the $3$-sphere is solved by G.Perelman by solving Thurston's program on geometrizations of $3$-manifolds.

A new confirmation of this conjecture:

Combining R. H. Bing's result on this conjecture with Smooth Unknotting Conjecture for an $S^2$ knot and Smooth 4D Poincaré Conjecture.

__Smooth Unknotting Conjecture__

Every smooth surface-knot $F$ in the $4$ dim. sphere $S^4$ is trivial surface-knot if $\pi_1(S^4 \setminus F, x_0)$ is an infinite cyclic group

__Smooth 4D Poincaré Conjecture__

Every $4$D smooth homotopy $4$-sphere is diffeomorphic to the $4$-sphere.

__Bing's theorem__

A homotopy $3$-sphere $M$ is diffeomorphic to $S^3$ if, for every knot $K$ in $M$, there is a $3$-ball in $M$ containing $K$.

=> A homotopy $3$-sphere is diffeomorphic to $S^3$ if for every knot $K$ in $M$, there is meridean-longitude-preserving isomorphism from $\pi_1(M \setminus K)$ onto $\pi_1(S^3 \setminus K')$ of a knot $K'$.(image of $K$?)

and by proving that A homotopy $3$-sphere meets the right above property, $3$D Poincaré conjecture is proved.

[Integral region choice problems on link diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16167)
> Tomomi Kawamura

Shimizu: A region crossing change unknotting operation for knot diagrams.

\textit{diagram} of link: the natural projection image on $\mathbb{R}^2$, a connected component of diagram is called \textit{region}

\textit{region crossing change} is an unknotting operation which change all crossings in the given region.

[Knots in homology lens spaces determined by their complements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16375)
> Kazuhiro Ichihara, Toshio Saito

Let $M$ be a homology lens space with $H_1 \simeq \mathbb{Z}_p$ and $K$ a not null-homologous knot in $M$.

Then $K$ is deterimined by its complement if $M$ is non-hyperbolic, $K$ is hyperbolic, and $p$ is a prime more thant $7$ or $M$ is a lens space and $K$ is a generator of $H_1(L(p,q))$.

[Knotoids, pseudo knotoids, Braidoids and pseudo braidoids on the Torus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16433)
> Ioannis Diamantis

__Knotoids__

Introduced by Turaev.

A generalization of $1-1$ tangles by allowing endpoints to be in different regions of the diagram.

Or, open knotted curves in oriented surfaces $\Sigma$

[The simple type conjecture for mod 2 Seiberg-Witten invariants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06791)
> Tsuyoshi Kato, Nobuhiro Nakamura, Kouichi Yasui

Under a simple condition on the cohomology ring, every closed $4$-manifold has $\pmod 2$ Seiberg-Witten simple type, and its corollaries.

It's about Seiberg-Witten invariant defined on a smooth $4$-manifold. ($25$ years!)

__Conjecture__

Every connected, closed, oriented, smooth $4$-manifold with $b_2^+ > 1$ has Seiberg-Witten simple type.

Manifolds of above type is called \textit{Seiberg-Witten simple type} if the Seiberg-Witten invariant $SW_X(\mathfrak{s})$ of a $\text{spin}^c$ structure $\mathfrak{s}$ on $X$ is $0$ whenever the virtual dimension $d_X(\mathfrak{s})$ of the Seiberg-Witten moduli space for $\mathfrak{s}$ is non-zero.

[Many closed K-magnetic geodesics on S2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04367)
> Roberta Musina, Fabio Zuddas

The motion $\gamma = \gamma(t)$ of a particle of unit mass and charge in $\mathbb{R}^3$, that experiences the Lorentz force $\boldsymbol{F}$ produced by the magnetostatic field $\boldsymbol{B}$

If the particle is constrained to the standard round sphere $\mathbb{S}^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3$, the motion law leads:
$$
\gamma'' + |\gamma'|^2 \gamma = K(\gamma)\gamma \wedge \gamma'
$$
where
$$
K(\gamma) := -\boldsymbol{B}(p) \cdot p,\, p \in \mathbb{S}^2
$$

A trajectory $\gamma$ satisfying the above equation is called $K$-magnetic geodesic.

[Geometric mean of probability measures and geodesics of Fisher information metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07211)
> Mitsuhiro Itoh, Hiroyasu Satoh

Geometric mean of two probability measures of density functions $p_1, p_2$, $\sqrt{p_1 p_2}$ with normalization.

Information geometry of the space $\mathcal{P}(M)$ of probability measures on a manifold $M$ equipped with Fisher information metric $G$. ...

[Closed geodesics with prescribed intersection numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16301)
> Yann Chaubet

$(\Sigma, g)$ be a closed, oriented, negatively curved Riemannian surface and denote by $\mathcal{P}$ the set of its oriented primitive closed geodesic.

For $L>0$ define $N(L) = \# \{\gamma \in \mathcal{P}, l(\gamma) \leq L \}$ where $l(\gamma)$ is the length of a geodesic $\gamma$.

a classical result, Margulis, $N(L) \sim \frac{e^{hL}}{hL}$ as $L \rightarrow \infty$
