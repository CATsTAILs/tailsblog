A _simplicial volume_, the sum of the hyperbolic volumes of the hyperbolic pices in the _Joco-Shalen_Johansson_ decompsosition of $\mathbb{S}^3 \setminus K$.

[Cusped spaces and quasi-isometries of relatively hyperbolic groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09876)
> Brendan Burns Healy, G. Christopher Hruska

Introduction to relatively hyperbolic groups and metric structures on their Bowditch boudnaries.

_relatively hyperbolic group_ : extension of Gromov's  original definition of a hyperbolic group.

_hyperbolic group_:  a finitely generated group equipped with a _word metric_ satisfying certain properties abstracted from classical hyperbolic geometry.

$G$ : a fin. gen. group, $X$: a Cayley graph of $G$ with graph metric. Then $G$ is said to be _hyperbolic_ if $X$ is a hyperbolic space(Gromov),

There exists a $\delta \geq 0$ s.t. any geodesic triangle in $X$ is $\delta$-thin($\delta$-slim).

__Hyperbolic__

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space, then __the Gromov poduct__ of $y, z \in X$ w.r.t. $x \in X$ is defined as:
$$
(y,z)_w = \frac{1}{2}(d(x,y) + d(x,z) - d(y,z))
$$

$X$ is $\delta$-hyperbolic iff $x,y,z,w \in X$ satisfying
$$
(x,z)_w \geq \min((x,y)_w, (y,z)_w) - \delta
$$
If the above condition holds for all $x,y,z \in X$ and one fixed basepoint $w_0$, then it is satisfied for all points with a constant $2\delta$ instead.

$X$ is said to be _hyperbolic_ if $X$ is $\delta$-hyperbolic for some $\delta$.

This definition can be expressed with triangles.($\delta$-thin!)

For a geodesic space $X$, for any point $m \in [x,y]$, there is a point $[y,z] \cup [x,z]$ at distance less than $\delta$ of $m$ (and for the other edges), for $\delta \geq 0$, the triangle is said to be $\delta$-slim.

And, a metric space $X$ is said to be $\delta$-slim if all the geodesic triangles are $\delta$-slim for some $\delta$. (by __Eliyahu Rips__)

The Eulicidean space is not hyperboic because of its homotheties.

[Knots with infinitely many non-characterizing slopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07163)
> Tetsuya Abe, Keiji Tagami

$6_3$ has infinitely many non-_characterizing_ slope. $\Rightarrow$ Baker and Motegi's question

Similarly, $6_2,6_3,7_6,7_7,8_1,8_3,8_4,8_6,8_7,8_9,8_{10},8_{11},8_{12},8_{13},8_{14},8_{17},8_{20},8_{21}$ have infinitely many non-characterizing slopes.

__Thm__ Lickorish and Wallace

Every closed, conected and orientable $3$-manifold is obtained by Dehn surgery on a link in $S^3$.

But it is not unique, for example, there is a infinite family of different knots in $S^3$such that $n$-surgery on those knots yields the same $3$-manifold.

Restricting to the specific surgery slope occur uniqueness.

Let $K$ be a knot in $S^3$, and $M_K(p/q)$ be the $3$-manifold obtained from $S^3$ by $p/q$-surgery on $K$.

A slope $p/q \in \mathbb{Q}$ is characterizing for$K$ if other knot $K'$ is isotopic to $K$ whenever $M_{K'}(p/q)$ is orientation-preservingly homeomorphic to $M_K(p/q)$.

$\Rightarrow$ surged manifold determine a knot type.

Current results:
* Every non-trivial slope of the unknot is csharacterizing (using monopole Floer homology).
* Every non-trivial slope of the trefoil and the figure eight knots is characterizing (using Heegard Floer homology).
* if $|p| \leq |q|$ and $|q|$ is sufficiently large, then $p/q$ is characterizing.

But, situations on the integral slope have different behaviors.

[Knot Floer homology of some even 3-stranded pretzel knots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04171)
> Konstantinos Varvarezos

Computing the Knot Floer Homology of $3$-stranded pretzel knots of the form $P(2a, -2b-1, \pm(2c+1))$ for positive integer $a,b,c$.

Examples of Pretzel knots

* $(p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n)$ is a knot iff $n, p_i$ are odd or exactly one of $p_i$ is even.
* $(p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n)$ is split if at least two of $p_i$ are zero. (converse is not true)
* $(-p_1, -p_2, \cdots, -p_n)$ is the mirror image of $(p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n)$
* $(p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n)$ is isotopic to $(p_2, p_3, \cdots, p_1)$
* $(p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n)$ is isotopic to $(p_n, p_{n-1}, \cdots, p_1)$ with opposite orientations.

In particular, $(-2, 3, 2n+1)$ pretzel links are useful in the study of $3$-manifolds. (Dehn surgery of this pretzel)

The hyperbolic volume of the complement  of $(-2, 3, 8)$ = $4 \times$ Catalan's constant

and its complement = one of two two-cusped hyperbolic mfds w/ min. possible volume, the other = the complement of the Whitehead link.

> Saikat Chatterjee, Praphulla Koushik

__Topological groupoid__

A topological groupoid over $B$ is a groupoid $G$ s.t. $B$ and $G$ are topological spaces and $\alpha, \beta$ and multiplication is continuous maps where $\alpha, \beta$ are maps from $G$ to $B$.

.. and there is a categorical defs.

[Connectivity of ample, conic and random simplicial complexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03952)
> Jonathan A. Barmak

$r$-conic simplicial complex is defined as a simplicial complex where every subcomplex of at most $r$ vertices is contained in the star of a vertex.

$4$-conic simplcial complex is simply connected, and $8$-conic complex is $2$-connected.

But it's not necessary for $2n+1$-conic copmlex to be $n$-connected but $6^n$-conic complex is $n$-connected.

And the probability of a complex being $n$-connected complex tends to $1$ as the number of vertices tends to $\infty$.

[Curvature Sets Over Persistence Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04470)
> Mario Gómez, Facundo Mémoli

_cuvature sets_ : an invariant of cpt metricspaces introduced by Gromov in the $1980$s

Apply this invariant to the Vietoris-Rips complex, authors call it _persistence sets_.

Pros: It is easier to compute than persistence diagram on VR complexes.

With a compact metric space $(X,d_X)$, Gromov defines for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the $n$-th curvature set of $X$, denoted $K_n(X)$, as the collection of all $n \times n$ matrices that arise from restricting $d_X$ to all possible $n-tuples$ of points chosen from $X$. (posib. with repetitions)

If $X$ and $Y$ are isometric, then $K_n(X) = K_n(Y)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

[One can't hear orientability of surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12498)
> Pierre Bérard, David L. Webb

The main result : One cannot hear orientability of a surface with a boundary.

Evidence : They construct two isospectral flat surfaces with boundary with the same Neumann spectrum but different orientability.

The expression is deriven from  'one cannot hear the shape of a drum.' (Kac's terminology .. PDE 관련이었든가)

[X-ray tomography of one-forms with partial data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05790)
> Joonas Ilmavirta, Keijo Mönkkönen

__X-ray transform__(Doppler transform)

$X_1f(\gamma) = \int_{\gamma} f$ where $\gamma$ is a line in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

__Question__ It is possible to reconstruct $f$ from $X_1f$?

__partial data problem__
Let $V \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, nonempty open set. Assume that $df|_V$ and $X_1f$ on all lines intersecting $V$ is known.

Then, Would you can find $f$ modulo potential fields(the solenoidal part $f^s$)?

Authors get some unique continuation result for the normal operator of the X-ray transform of one-forms, and two proofs of the partial data result.
