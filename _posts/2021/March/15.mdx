[Arc-connectedness for the space of smooth Zd-actions on 1-dimensional manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06940)
> Hélène Eynard-Bontemps, Andrés Navas

__Q.__ Is the space of orientation preserving commuting circle diffeomorphisms locally arcwise connected?

__A.__ The space of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ actions by $C^2$ orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of a compact $1$-manifold is $C^{1+\text{ac}}$($C^1$and abs.continuous) arcwise connected.

Main idea = Averaging actions

[Minimal Euler Characteristics for Even-Dimensional Manifolds with Finite Fundamental Group](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00703)
> Alejandro Adem, Ian Hambleton

$2n$-manifolds $M$ with $(n-1)$-connected universal cover and the fundamental group $G$ of type $F_n$ (there is a model for $K(G,1)$ with finite $n$-skeleton).

then the minimal value of Euler characteristic of $M$ can be calculated.

The rational cohomology of $4$-spheres (with finite fund. group) are related.

If $G$ is a finite abelian group minimally generated by $k>3$ elements, then it cannot be realized as the fundamental group of a closed $4$-manifold which is a rational homology sphere.

[Lissajous 3-braids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00585)
> Eiko Kin, Hiroaki Nakamura, Hiroyuki Ogawa

A losed curve on $\mathbb{C}$ defined with a real parameter $t \in \mathbb{R}$ for given two parameters $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$:
$$
L(t) = \sin(2 \pi mt) + i \sin(2 \pi nt),\ (t \in \mathbb{R}, i=\sqrt{-1})
$$
is called a _Lissajous curve_ of type $(m, n)$.

[Footprints of geodesics in persistent homology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07158)
> Žiga Virk

Given a metric space $X$ with a subspace $A$. Then $A$ can _generate_ various algebraic elements in pH of $X$, which is called _footprints_ of $A$. 

Footprints appear in dimensions above $\text{im}(A)$, especially a link between geodesics and pH are introduced.

What kind of filters used? : Čech and VR of geodesics space, space with _geodesic metric_ (not only for just metric, e.g. Fisher metric can be considered.)

__NOTE:__ A metric spacemay have no geodesics except constant curves.

__Fisher metric__

For a given probability distribution $p(x, \theta)$ with random variable $X$,

The _Fisher metric_ is defined as:
$$
\displaystyle g_{jk}(\theta) = \int_X \frac{\partial \log p(x,\theta)}{\partial \theta_j} \frac{\partial \log p(x,\theta)}{\partial \theta_k} p(x,\theta) dx.
$$

It could be described as follows:
$$
g_{jk}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}[\frac{\partial^2 i(x,\theta)}{\partial\theta_j \partial\theta_k}].
$$
where $i(x,\theta) = -\log p(x,\theta)$ from information theory.

From the Hopf map, $S^1 \mapsto S^3 \to S^2$, it can be shown that $\pi_3(S^2)$ is not trivial.

In similar sense, non-trivial elements in pH in dimension $k$ may be generated by features of dimension less than $k$.

Blueprints : Thm $4.5.$ and $5.3.$(footprint detection) $\rightarrow$ Thm $7.1.$, for a loop $A$, footprint may containa $2$-dimensional interval not contained in the pH of $A$ (sometimes)

[Alexander polynomial of ribbon knots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07128)
> Sheng Bai

Alexander polynomial has the form $f(t)f(t^{-1})$ for some integer coefficients polynomial $f(t)$ with the signautre $=0$ and the determinant is the square of an integer.

__Ribbon knots__

Let $r:D^2 \to S^3$ be an immersion. If each component of the singularities of $r(D^2)$ is an arc and one component of its preimage in $D^2$ is interior, then $r(\partial D^2)$ is called a _ribbon knot_, and $r(D^2)$ is a _ribbon_.

and it is a subclass of slices knots and conjectured to be all of them. Ribbon knots are easy to calculate the Alexander polynomial..

[Crosscap number and epimorphisms of two-bridge knot groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05009)
> Jim Hoste, Patrick D. Shanahan, Cornelia A. Van Cott

The crosscap number and partial order derived from epimorphisms between complements of prime knots.

If $K$ and $J$ are $2$-bridge knots and $K>J$ then $\gamma(K) \geq 3 \gamma(J)-4$.

Similary, $g(K) \geq 3 g(J)-1$ is proved from Suzuki and Tran, where $g(K)$  denotes the genus of the knot $K$.

the _crosscap_ number (=nonorientable genus) of a knot $K$ in the $3$-sphere, $\gamma(K)$, is defined as:

the smalleset first Betti number of any embedded, compact, connected, nonorientable surface in $S$^3 that spans $K$.

$\gamma(K)=1$ iff it bounds a Möbius band and hence is a $(2,2k+1)$-cable for some knot.

As a corolarry, $(2,2k+1)$-torus knot has the crosscap number $=1\ ^\forall k$.

It is not additive w.r.t. connected sum however,
$$
\gamma(K_1) + \gamma(K_2) - 1 \leq \gamma(K_1 \# K_2) \leq \gamma(K_1) + \gamma(K_2)
$$
and
$$
\gamma(K) \leq 2 g(K) + 1
$$
the equality holds for $7_4$, $\gamma(7_4) = 3$.

Hatcher-Thurston, Bessho, Hirasawa-Teragaito provide a practical way to compute the crosscap number of any $2$-bridge knot.

__How to compute?__(Hirasawa-Teragaito)

__1__ Choose some fraction $p/q$ represents $K$ as a Conway form.

__2__ Choose some expansion $p/q = [a_1, \cdots, a_n]$

__3__ Repeating __2__ with $3$ shortening moves, find a shortest continued fraction expansion as $r$.

__4__ Then, the results, $[a_1, \dots, a_n]$, satisfy:

If some $a_i$ is odd / $\pm 2$, then $\gamma(K_{p/q})=n$, $\gamma(K_{p/q})=n+1$

[More 1-cocycles for classical knots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04624)
> Thomas Fiedler

> cocycle expert?

Combinatoial $1$-cocycles depending on integer parameters for knots in the solid torus.

It gives invariants for knots in $\mathbb{R}^3$, often called classical knots.

[Domination by geometric 4-manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06454)
> Jonathan A. Hillman

"When is a closed orientable $4$-manifold $Y$ dominated by another suchc manifold $X$?"
