__Q.__ What is _the Digital Plane_?

AFPP : The Approximate Fixed Point Property, which is a property for fixed points in digital topology.

__A.__ $\mathbb{Z}^2$

[Singquandles, Psyquandles and Singular Knots: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05620)
> Jose Ceniceros, Indu R. Churchill, Mohamed Elhamdadi, Mustafa Hajij

Algebraic structures related to _singular knot theory_ : quandles, psyquandles and singquandles.

Esp. focusing on the singquandles first, then psyquandles(gen. of oriented signquandles)

Fox, 1961, A quick trip through knot theory : a digrammatic definition of colorability of a knot is introduced $\rightarrow$ an invarinat of knots!

_Quandle_ is introduced $80$s by Joyce and Matveev, independently.

__Rack__

A set $R$ with a binary operation $\lhd$ such that for every $a,b,c \in R$, the self-distributive law holds:
$$
a \lhd (b \lhd c) = (a \lhd b) \lhd (a \lhd c)
$$
and for every $a,b \in R$, there exists a unique $c \in R$ such that
$$
a \lhd c = b
$$
.. but the above definition is suboptimal for certain purposes ...(it contains an existential quantifier which is not really necessary)

To avoid this, define the unique $c \in R$ such that $a \lhd c = b$ as $b \rhd a$, then
$$
a \lhd c = b \Leftrightarrow c = b \rhd a
$$
and thus
$$
a \lhd (b \rhd a) = b = (a \lhd b) \rhd a
$$

And there are various way to define rack equivalently.

__Quandle__

A quandle is a rack $(R, \lhd)$ with additional property
$$
a \lhd a = a
$$
or equivalently,
$$
a \rhd a = a
$$

e.g. $a \lhd b = aba^{-1}$ is a quandle with $b \rhd a = a^{-1}ba = a{-1} \lhd b$.

__Singular Knot__

The theory of singular knots was itnroduced in the $90$s by V. A. Vassiliev, in _Cohomology of knot spaces_.

A singular knot is an immersed circle in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with finitely many transverse double points. [What is a Singular Knot?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08543)
