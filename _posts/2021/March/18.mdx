[Producing circle patterns via configurations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13076)
> Ze Zhou

__Circle pattern__

A circle pattern $\mathcal{P}$ on the Riemann sphere $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ is a collection of closed disks on $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$.

The contact graph $G_{\mathcal{P}}$ of such a pattern $\mathcal{P}$ is the graph having a vertex for each disk, and having an edge between two vertices if the corresponding disks intersect each other. (kind of nerve?)

There is a basic background monograph on circle patterns.. Is it a book? [Link]()

Thurston observed that there was a direct  connection between circle patterns and hyperbolic polyhedra.

In the Poincaré model of hyperbolic $3$-space $\mathbb{H}^3$, associate each closed disk in circle pattern on $=\partial\mathbb{H}^3$ with the hyperbolic half-space which is identical to the closed convex hull of ideal points in $\hat{\mathbb{C}} \setminus D \subset \partial \mathbb{H}^3$.

Under suitable conditions, the intersection of half-spaces of a circle pattern gives a hyperbolic polyhedron, with combinatorics dual to the contact graph and dihedral angles equal to the corresponding exterior intersection angles. (Ch 13.)

[Isoperimetric inequalities for Poincaré duality groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07812)
> Dawid Kielak, Peter Kropholler

"The classification of $2$-dimensional Poincaré duality groups over $\mathbb{Z}$""

__Poincaré Duality Groups__ [Ref](https://people.math.osu.edu/davis.12/pdgroup.pdf)

A space $X$ is aspherical if $\pi_i(X) = 0$ for all $i > 1$ $\Leftrightarrow$ the condition that its universal covering space is contractible in homotopy type of a $CW$-complex sense.

Given any group $\Gamma$, there is an aspherical $CW$-complex $B\Gamma=K(\Gamma,1)$, which  is classifying space of $\Gamma$. (Eilenberg-MacLane space!)

The classifying space is unique up to homotopy equivalence. $\Rightarrow$ The (co)homology of a group!

Examples for aspherical spaces: Manifold, and Poincaré duality holds for them, so _$n$-dimensional Poincaré duality group $\Gamma$_ could be defined/considered.

It is a defined as $H^i(\Gamma;A) \cong H_{n-i}(\Gamma;A)$ for an arbitrary $\mathbb{Z}\Gamma$-module.

Since (co)homology of a group $\Gamma$ is defined as (co)homology of its classifying space, any group realized as the fundamental group of some manifold(closed, aspherical) is $n$-dimensional Poincaré duality group.

The converse is __false__  but true for a finitely presented($\pi_1$ for closed manifold must be) Poincaré duality group.

[Statistics of finite degree covers of torus knot complements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11956)

[Lengths of closed geodesics on random surfaces of large genus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09727)
> Maryam Mirzakhani, Bram Petri

Poisson approximation results for the bottom part of the length spetrum of a random closed hyperbolic surface of large genus.

[Satellites and Lorenz knots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09500)
> Thiago de Paiva, Jessica S. Purcell

Infinite familes of Lorenz knots that are satellites but not cables, counterexamples to a conjecture attributed to Morton.

Lorenz knots/links are initially described in applied dynamical systems: As a closed periodic orbits of a system of ordinary differential equations studied by meteorologist E. N. Lorenz to predict __weather patterns__.

Every torus knot is a Lorenz knot. (Birman and Williams)

Lorenz knots coincide with periodic orbits in the geodesic flow on the modular surface(Ghys)

Review article for Lorenz knot: [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0214)

__Lorenz knot__ is defined to  be a closed periodic orbit in the flow $\lambda^t : \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ determined by equations:
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = 10(y-x), \frac{dy}{dt}=28x - y - xz, \frac{dz}{dt} = xy - \frac{8}{3}z
$$

[Some generalizations of Satoh's Tube map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08766)

Satoh defined a map from virtual link diagrams to ribbon surfaces knotted in $S^4$ or $\mathbb{R}^4$, he called it \textit{Tube}, perserves the knot group and the knot quandle.

[A combinatorial description of the LOSS Legendrian knot invariant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07610)
> Dongtai He, Linh Truong

Heegaard Floer  invariant of Legendrian knots in contact three-manifolds (defined by Lisca-Ozsváth-Stipsicz-Szabó)

Although Heegaard Floer involves analytic counts of pseudo-holomorphic disks in the symmetric product of a surface,

certain Heegaard Floer homologies admit a purely __combinatorial description__.

__Legendrian knot__

A knot which is everywhere tanget to the contact plane field $\xi$

[Super Hyperbolic Law of Cosines: same formula with different content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07709)

[Virtual Multicrossings and Petal Diagrams for Virtual Knots and Links](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08314)
> Colin Adams, Chaim Even-Zohar, Jonah Greenberg, Reuben Kaufman, David Lee, Darin Li, Dustin Ping, Theodore Sandstrom, Xiwen Wang

Knots/Links invariants?

The crossing number $c(L(C))$ :the least number of double points for any projection of $L$, where only two strands can cross at a point.

Vaughan Jones proved that every knot has a projection wth only triple crossings.

Every link has an $n$-crossing projection for $n\geq2$. $\Rightarrow$ all crossings in the projectionare _multicrossings_ with$n$ strands.

[Bicycle paths, elasticae and sub-Riemannian geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04201)
> Andrey Ardentov, Gil Bor, Enrico Le Donne, Richard Montgomery, Yuri Sachkov


__Bicycle path__

An oriented line segment of fixed length $l$ in the Euclidean plane. it is considered as a bicycle, so that its end points mark the points of contact of the front and back wheels with the ground.

And traces of front/end point is called front/back tracks.

the _no-skid_ condition : the line segment must be tangent to the back track at each instant.

Any such motion of a line segment : a bicycle path!

[Computing the Multicover Bifiltration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07823)

Given a finite set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, let $\text{Cov}_{r,k}$ denote the set of all points within distance $r$ to at least $k$ points of $A$.

Then $\text{Cov}_{r,k}$ become $2$-parameter family of spaces that grow larger when $r$ increases or $k$ decreases, called the multicover biflitraion.

topologically equiv. construction : polyhedral and simplicial versions. (and far smaller than Čech filt.)
