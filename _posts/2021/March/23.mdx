[On characteristic numbers of 24 dimensional String manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11413)
> Fei Han, Ruizhi Huang

Let $M$ be a $4m$ dimensional oriented closed manifold, $M$ is called _Spin_ if the second Stiefel-Whitney class $\omega_2(M) = 0$.

To see its geometry/topology, its characteristic numbers as cobordism invariants were investigated in a classical way.

A _string structure_ on a manifold is a higher version of a spin structure...  lots of alg. geom. things...

__Pontryagin number__

given a real vector bundle $E$ over $M$, its $k$-th  Pontryagin class $p_k(E)$ is defined as
$$
p_k(E)  = p_k(E,\mathbb{Z}) (-1)^k c_{2k}(E \otimes \mathbb{C}) \in H^{4k}(M,\mathbb{Z})
$$
where $E \otimes \mathbb{C}$ is the complexification of $E$, $E \otimes \mathbb{C} = E \otimes iE$.

[Faithfullness of geometric action of skein algebras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11532)
> Thang T. Q. Le

__Kauffman bracket__

Let $\mathcal{R}$ be a commutative domain with unit, equipped with a distinguished invertible element $q$.

Suppose $M$ is an oriented $3$-manifold with possibly non-empty boundary $\partial M$.

The _skein module_ $\mathscr{S}(M)$ is the $\mathcal{R}$-module generated by isotopy classes of framed unoriented links n $M$ modulo the Kauffman relatons.
$$
\text{top-right crossing} = q*\text{left-right disconnected arcs} + q^{-1}\text{top-bottom disconneceted arcs}
$$
$$
\text{trivial} = (-q^2-q^-2)(\text{empty})
$$

[A relative version of the Turaev-Viro invariants and the volume of hyperbolic polyhedral 3-manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04813)
> Tian Yang

Let $M$ be a compact $3$-manifold with non-empty boundary, and $\mathcal{T}$ be an ideal triangulation of $M$, a finite collection $T = \{ \Delta_1, \cdots, \Delta_{|T|} \}$ of truncated Euclidean tetrahedra withfaces identified win pairs by affine homeomorphisms.

Also let $E = \{ e_1, \cdots, e_{|E|} \}$ be the set of edges of $\mathcal{T}$.

A _coloring_, for a positive integer $r \geq 3$, of $(M, \mathcal{T})$ assigns an integer $a_i$ in between $0$ and $r-2$ to the edge $e_i$,

And the coloring is _$r$-admissible_ if for any $\{ i, j, k \} \subset \{ 1, \cdots, |E| \}$ such that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a_i + a_j - a_k \geq 0 \\
& a_i + a_j + a_k \leq 2(r-2) \\
& a_i + a_j + a_k \text{ is even.}
\end{aligned}
$$

__Double__

If $M$ is a manifold with boundary, its _double_ is obtained by gluing two copies of $M$ together along their common boundary.

Although the concepts makes sense for any manifold, even for some non-manifold such as _Alexander horned sphere_, the notion of doulbe is used generally in the context that $\partial M$ is non-empty and $M$ is compact.

Let $D(M)$ be the double of $M$ and $D(E) \subset D(M)$ is the link consisting of the union of the double of the edges.

Then,  __Thm 1.5.__ states that:

The Volume Conjecture of the relative Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants is true for all pairs $(D(M), D(E))$ with sufficiently small cone angles.

A specific formula is omitted... it's too complex for me yet..

[Choosing points on cubic plane curves: rigidity and flexibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03824)
> Ishan Banerjee, Weiyan Chen

Let $\mathcal{X}$ denote the space of all smooth cubic plane curves:
$$
\mathcal{X} = \{ F(x,y,z) | F \text{ is a nonsingular homogeneous polynomial of degree 3} \} /\mathbb{C}^\times.
$$
Let $\pi:E \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$ denote the universal cubic plane curve, a fiber bundle  whose fiber over $F \in \mathcal{X}$ is the smooth cubic plane curve $C_F$ defined by the equation $F=0$.

A multisection of $\pi$ of degree $n$ is a continuous section of an associated bundle whose fiber over $F \in \mathcal{X}$ is $\text{UConf}_n(C_F)$, the space of $n$ distinct unordered points in $C_F$:
$$
\begin{aligned} 
\text{UConf}_n(C_F) & \rightarrow & E_n & \rightarrow & \mathcal{X} \\
& & & \dashleftarrow
\end{aligned}
$$

[On inequalities between unknotting numbers and crossing numbers of spatial embeddings of trivializable graphs and handlebody-knots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11079)
> Yuta Akimoto

Let $L$ be a link in the $3$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$.

The _unknotting number_ $u(L)$ is the minimal number of crossing changes from $L$ to a trivial link.

The crossing number $c(L)$ is the minimal number of crossing points  among all regular diagrams of $L$.

It is well-knowned that $u(L)$ is less than or equal to half of $c(L)$. Taniyama characterized the links which satisfy the quality as follows.

__Thm 1.1.__

Let $L$ be a $\mu$-component link that satisfies the quality $u(L) = \frac{c(L)}{2}$. Then $L$ has a diagram $D = \gamma_1  \cup \cdots \cup \gamma_\mu$ such that each $\gamma_i$  is a simple closed curve on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and for each pair $i, j,$ the subdiagram $\gamma_i \cup \gamma_j$ is an alternating diagram or a diagram without crossings.

and its application to (trivializable) planar graph,  and..

__Prop 1.4.__ 

Let $K$ be a nontrivial knot, then $\displaystyle u(K) \leq \frac{c(K) - 1}{2}$

__Thm 1.5.__

Let $K$ be a nontrivial knot satisfying $\displaystyle u(K) = \frac{c(K)-2}{2}$. Then $K$ is a $(2, p)$-torus knot for some odd number $p \neq \pm1$.

__Prop 1.6.__  

Let  $H$ be a non-trivial handlebody-knot, then $u(H) \leq \frac{c(H)-1}{2}$.

A _handlebody-knot_ is an embedded handlebody in the $3$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$.

Two handlebody-knot are equivalent if there is an orientation-preserving homemorphism of $\mathbb{R}^3$ with sending one knot to the other.

[Introduction to orbifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08699)
> Francisco C. Caramello Jr

_Orbitfolds_  are amongst the simplest generalizations of manifolds that include singularities, are topological spaces locally modeled on quotients of $\mathbb{R}^n$ by a finite group action.

it is appearing in _AG_, _DG_, and _string_ theory.

Author took classic approach via local charts and atlases

Manifold : well-behaved spaces but forces to have poor algebraic properties(not  closed under (co)limits, quotients, $\cdots$)

Maybe... this is what I was looking forward!

[Smooth approximations in PL geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10834)
> José F. Fernando, Riccardo Ghiloni

The __Whitney Approximation Theorem__

Any continuous map between smooth manifolds is homotopic to a smooth map.

[Some topological results of Ricci limit spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11344)
> Jiayin Pan, Jikang Wang

a __Ricci limit space__ $(X, p)$ which is the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of  a sequencce of complete $n$-manifolds $(M_i, p_i)$(pointed complete Riemannian $n$-manifold) with $\text{Ric} \geq -(n-1)$.

[Hilbert's third problem and a conjecture of Goncharov](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07112)
> Jonathan Campbell, Inna Zakharevich

__Hilbert's  third  problem__

Given two polyhedra $P$ and $Q$, when is it possible to decompose $P$ into finitely many polyhedra and form $Q$ out of the pieces? 

A pair $(P, Q)$ for which the above relation holds, is called _scissors congruent_.

If they are scissors congruent, then their volumes are equal. (reverse is not true)

A second invariant , _Dehn invariant_ exists. It is defined as:
$$
\displaystyle D(P) = \sum_{e \text{ edge of } P} \text{len}(e) \otimes \theta(e) \in \mathbb{R} \otimes \mathbb{R}/\pi\mathbb{Z}
$$
wehre $\theta(e)$ is the dihedral angle at $e$, in other words, it is the arc length of the intersection with $P$ of a small circle around $e$.

In dimension $n$, it is also able to be defined by picking $l$-dimensional faces and replace angles by a portion of the $n-l-1$ sphere.

By the Dehn-Sydler theorem, in Euclidean space of dim $3$ and $4$,  two polytopes are scissors congruent iff their volumes and Dehn invariants are equal.
