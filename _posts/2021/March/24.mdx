[One conjecture on cut points of virtual links and the arrow polynomial of twisted links](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12283)
> Qingying Deng, Shudan Xue

Checkerboard framings - an extension of checkerboard colorings (for virtual links)

Dye, 2017, obtained an independent invariant of virtual links: the cut point number.

Checkerboard framings and cut points can be extended to other _classical_ invariants to virtuallinks.

__Virtual Llinks__

Based on Gauss code, correspond to stable equivalence classes of links in oriented $3$-manifolds which are __thickend__ closed oriented surfaces (1996, Kauffman).

The fundamental group of a virtual link may not be _residually finite_ $\rightarrow$ it may not be the fundamental group of any $3$-manifold.

The classical relation between the Jones  poly's exponents and the number of link components only holds if the link has a $2$-colorable diagram (N.Kamada)

Twisted knot theory : an extension of virtual knot theory! It is focused on link diagrams on closed, possibly non-orientable surfaces.

Twisted links are in one-to-one correspondence with abstract links on (ori. or non ori.) surfaces, virtual links are regarded as twisted links.

(S. Kamada, N.Kamada) When two virtual links are equivalent as twisted links?

A _virtual link diagram_ is a link diagram which may have virtual crossings: "encircled crossings" without over/under information.

A _twisted linik diagram_ is a virtual link diagram which may have some "bars".

A _virtual link_ is an equivalence class of a virtual link diagram by Reidemeisster moves and virtual Reidemeister moves

..bar.. change of orientation?

__Profinite Completetion__

: It is a version ff finite detection problem  asking to what extent a topological invariant of a $3$-manifold $M$ is determined by the isomorphism class of the profinite completetion of the $3$-manifold group $\pi=\pi_1(M)$.

[Partial Matching in the Space of Varifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12441)
> Pierre-Louis Antonsanti, Joan Glaunès, Thomas Benseghir, Vincent Jugnon, Irène Kaltenmark

The computer vision / medical imaging .. automatic annotation!

.. In medical .. it often happens that only part of an object is visible in one of the two modalities.

"Finding an optimal deformation to  register a source shape $S$ onto an unknown subset of a target space $T$".

where $S,T$ are assumed to be finite unions of $m$-dimensional submanifolds of $E = \mathbb{R}^d$ with either $m=1$ or $m=d-1$.

The __Varifold__ framework for shape matching

$S$, and $T$ are assumed to be compact $m$-rectifiable subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$, at almost every point in $S$, a unit tangent/normal vector is defined.

Let $W$ be a __Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space__(RKHS) of functions defined over $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$, continuously embedded in $C_0(\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{S}^{d-1})$.

1. Varifolds

measure-theoretic gen. of the concept of a diff. Mfd.

Given an open subset $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $m$-dimensional varifold on $\Omega$ is defined as a Radon measure on the set
$$
\Omega \times G(n,m)
$$

where $G(n,m)$ is the Grassmannian of all $m$-dimensional linear subspaces of an $n$-dimensional vector space. ..?

2. RKHS

A Hilbert space of functions where point evaluation is a continuous linear functional, roughly, two functions in RKHS are close in norm then thoes are also close pointwise close.

[A quasiconformal Hopf soap bubble theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12665)
> Jose A. Galvez, Pablo Mira, Marcos P. Tassi

__Hopf's soap bubble theorem__

It is one of the fundamental theorems of constant mean curvature(CMC) theory.

Statement: Any CMC sphere immersed in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is as round sphere!

The extended statements exist. For example, The elliptic Weingarten spheres in $\mathbb{R}^3$, CMC spheres in  Riemannian homogeneous $3$-manifold ...
