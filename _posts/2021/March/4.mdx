# Arxiv Check

## AT

[Online High-Dimensional Change-Point Detection using Topological Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00117)
> Xiaojun Zheng, Simon Mak, Yao Xie

(Persistent Diagram based) Change-Point(PD-CP) .. nonparametric change-point detection? / the distribution of points on persistence diagrams for _online_ detection

__1__ a histogram representation constructed for each persistence diagram / time

> distribute barcodes into $M$ different bins depending on its birth time, and sum up persistences of barcodes in the same bin.
>
> It's the form which is used in _recent developed method_..?? (allows us to leverage recent developments in empirical distribution based change-point
methods)

"breakpoints for the bins" are trained (before abrupt change)

* 인포리언스 독자적 개발 .. CoDIP?

__2__ _online non-parametric hypothesis test_ to detect abrupt(급격한) top. changes

_non-parametric detection statistic_

building the lower star filtration of both connected components and holes on $T$=300 images $\sim 90$ sec (RIPSER).

[An introduction to Topological Data Analysis: fundamental and practical aspects for data scientists](  )
> Frédéric Chazal (1), Bertrand Michel (2) ((1) DATASHAPE, (2) LSTA)

Tools for pH
* Gudhi (Maria et al., Fasy et al.(R))
* Dionysus, PHAT, DIPHA, Giotto

Backbone

__1__ Distance(similarity) function on data -> metric of an ambient space

__2__ _Continuous_ shape is built on top of the data.(simplicial complex w/ filtration)

__3__ Extract top/geo info from the structures built on the data. Show _relativity_ like stability on the noise. Statistical are used.

__4__ Provide new families of features from extrated info.

[On Information Links](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02002)
> Pierre Baudot

Knot theory + Information theory, prob = linking number?

Suggest : the negative minima of the $3$-way multivariate mutual information correspond to Borromean link, gen. the correspondence of the minima of $k$ multivariate interaction information with $k$ _Brunnian_ links in the binary variable case.

[R-torsion of Compact Orientable Surfaces via Pants Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02003)
> Esma Dirican Erdal, Yaşar Sözen

History:

Reidemeister : Classify 3-dim lens spaces using R-torsion

Franz : Generalize R-torsion on other dimensions

Kirby-Siebenmann : Shown to be a topologicalinvariant

and It is also an invariant of the basis of the homology of a manifold, is equal to the analytic torsion for compact orientable Riemannian manifolds.

Let $\Sigma_{g,n}$ denote the compact orientable surface with genus $g \geq 2$ and boundary disjoint union of $n$ circles.

By using a particular pants-decomposition of it, a formula computing the R-torsion of $\Sigma_{g,n}$ in terms of R-torsions of pairs of pants.

[Farber's conjecture for planar graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13530)
> Ben Knudsen

For a topological(?) space $X$, Topological complexity $TC(X)$ is introduced as a numerical invariant by __Farber__.

## DG

[A note on the periodic orbit conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02481)
> Robert Cardona

__The periodicorbit conjecture__:

On closed manifolds, the set of lengths of the orbits of a non-vanishing vector field all whose orbits are closeed admits an upper bound.

It is false by a counterexample by Sullivan, but true under geometric condition, _begin geodesible_.

Author use the recent characterization of Eulerisable flows to prove that the conjecture for lager class of vector fields.

[Geometric Invariants of Plane and Space Curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16415)
> Hana Melanova

Traditional study of plane/space algebraic curves by looking at their tangent vectors/curvatures/torsions -> not sufficitent.

Author gen. classical curvature/torsion to higher algebraic curvatures.
