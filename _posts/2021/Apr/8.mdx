[Identifying the latent space geometry of network models through analysis of curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10559)
> Shane Lubold, Arun G. Chandrasekhar, Tyler H. McCormick

_Statiscally modeling networks_

_More positive curvature_ in the manifold encourages more and tighter communities.

So, the choice of the latent geometry is important.

The authors suggest a method to estimate "consistently".

Insights: Representing the graph as a noisy distance matrix based on the ties between cliques.

[Fractional Fibonacci groups with an odd number of generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03378)
> Ihechukwu Chinyere, Gerald Williams

The Fibonacci groups $F(n)$ have different behaviour depending on the parity of $n$.

Extend them to the family of Fractional Fibonacci groups $F^{k/l}(n)$.

where the _Fibonacci_ groups
$$
F(n) = \langle x_0, \cdots, x_{n-1} | x_i x_{i+1} = x_{i+2} \rangle
$$

and the _Fractional Fibonacci groups_
$$
F^{k/l}(n) = \langle x_0, \cdots, x_{n-1} \vert x^l_i x^k_{i+1} = x^l_{i+2}
$$

for the case $k=l=1$, $l=1$, or the case of coprime integers $k,l$, it has been shown to be fundamental groups of $3$-manifolds.

$k=l=1$, if $n$ is even then $F(n)$ is the fundamental group of a $3$-manifold, $n/2$-fold cyclic cover of $S^3$ branched over the figure eight knot.

If $n\geq 3$ tand odd then $F(n)$ is not the fundamental group of any hyperbolic $3$-orbifold of finite volume, and so on ..

[Untying knots in 4D and Wedderburn's Theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00326)
> Igor Nikolaev

(2트) __Wedderburn__ Theorem says that finite non-commutative fields cannot exist! (roughly)


[The A-Polynomial and Knot Volume](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01251)
> Marc Schilder

Conjecture of a connection between the $A$-polynomial of a knot in $\mathbb{S}^3$ and the hyperbolic volume of its exterior, the knots with zero hyperbolic volume are exactly the knots with an $A$-polynomial where every irreducible factor is the sum of two monomials in $L$ and $M$.

and, suggest that the inverse may be true.

The $A$-polynomial of hyperbolic knots are known to have at least one irreducible factor which is not the sum of two monomials in $L$ and $M$.

[Effective mapping class group dynamics II: Geometric intersection numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01694)
> Francisco Arana-Herrera

_By studying how the corresponding action on the space of closed curves changes their geometric intersection numbers._

.. forget to study intersection numbers.. (hard to read)

[Average four-genus of two-bridge knots](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05721)
> Sebastian Baader, Alexandra Kjuchukova, Lukas Lewark, Filip Misev, Arunima Ray

The expected value of the ratio between the smooth four-genus and the Seifert genus of two-bridge knots tends to zero as the crossing number tends to $\infty$.

[Untwisting 3-strand torus knots](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01003)
> Sebastian Baader, Ian Banfield, Lukas Lewark

The signature bound for the topological $4$-genus of $3$-strand torus knots .. is __sharp__!

[Hyperbolic 3-manifolds with large kissing number](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01863)
> Cayo Dória, Plinio G. P. Murillo

The _systole_ of $M$ is the shortest length of a nontrivial closed geodesic, denoted by $\text{sys}(M)$.

A related invariant is the _kissing number_, $\text{Kiss}(M)$, the number of free homotopy classes of oriented closed geodescis in $M$ of length $\text{sys}(M)$.

[A sequence of algebraic integer relation numbers which converges to 4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09560)
> Wonyong Jang, KyeongRo Kim

The subgroup $G_\alpha$, which is generated by $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $B_{\alpha} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ \alpha & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

A generalization of the Farey graph for the subgroup $G_\alpha$, the graph is free iff $G_\alpha$ is a free group of rank $2$.

Authors construct a sequence of real numbers so that the sequence converges to $4$ and each number has the corresponding group which is not a free group of rank $2$, and the real numbers are algebraic intergers.

[Addendum to: Guts, Volume and Skein Modules of 3-Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06388)
> Brandon Bavier

In _Guts, Volume, and Skein Modules of 3-Manifolds_, author showed that the twist number of certain hyperbolic weakly generalized alternating links can be recovered from a Jones-like polynomial.
