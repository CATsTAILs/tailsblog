[0-Shake Slice Knots are Slice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00247)
> Selman Akbulut

_Recall_ a knot $K \subset S^3$ is called _slice_ if it is the boudnary of a properly imbedded smooth disk $D^2 \subset B^4$ (sliced by $S^3$?)

__Definition of framing..?__ ($h_K(r)$)

$K$ is _$r$-shake slice_ if a generator of $H_2(K^r) = \mathbb{Z}$ is represented by a smoothly imbedded $2$-sphere in $K^r$.

where $K^r = B^4 + h_K(r)$ is the $4$-manifold obtained by attaching a $2$-handle to $B^4$ along ther knot $K$ with _framing_ $r$.

[Hyperbolic volume, mod 2 homology, and k-freeness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03676)
> Rosemary K. Guzman, Peter B. Shalen

If $M$ is any closed, orientable hyperbolic $3$-manifold with $\text{vol}{M} \leq 3.69$, then $\dim{H_1(M;\mathbb{F}_2)} \leq 7$.

As a consequence of the __Mostow Rigidity Theorem__, a finite-volume hyperbolic $3$-manifold is determined up to isometry by its topology type, any geometrically defiend invariant of such a manifold, such as its volume, may be regarded as a topological invariant.

It has long been known that for any prime $p$, the dimension of $H_1(M;\mathbb{F}_p)$ is liniearly bounded in terms of $\text{vol}M$.

[Homological Filling Functions with Coefficients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13489)
> Xingzhe Li, Fedor Manin

Geometric group theoriest $\rightarrow$ isoperimetric phenomena! __e.g.__ Dehn function.

__Area of a relation $w$__

Let $G = \langle X \vert R \rangle$.

$w$ is a relation $\Leftrightarrow$ $w$ belongs to the normal closure of $R$ __i.e.__ there exists a representation of $w$ as
$$
w = u_1 r_1 u_1^{-1} \cdots u_m r_m u_m^{-1} \text{ in } F(X)
$$
where $m \geq 0$ and where $r_i \in R^{\pm 1}$ for $i=1,\cdots,m$.

the _area_ of $w$ with respect $G = \langle X \vert R \rangle$, denoted $\text{Area}(w)$, is the smallest $m \geq 0$ such that there exists a representation like above for $w$ ans the product in $F(X)$ of $m$ conjugates of elements of  $R^{\pm 1}$.

It can be shown that $\text{Area}(w)$ is the smallest number of $2$-cells in a van Kampen diagram over $G=\langle X \vert R \rangle$ with boundary cycle labelled by $w$.

The _Dehn function_ of a finite presentation is defined as
$$
\text{Dehn}(n) = \max\{ \text{Area}(w) \vert w = 1 \in G,\, |w| \leq n,\, w \text{ freely reduced.} \}
$$
or, defined as the smallest isoperimetric function for $G=\langle X \vert R \rangle$, for any other isoperimetric function $f(n)$, we have $\text{Dehn}(n) \leq f(n)$ for every $n \geq 0$.

where an _isoperimetric function_ for a finite presentation is a monotone non-decreasing function
$$
f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow [0, \infty)
$$
such that $\text{Area}(w) \leq f(|w|)$ for every freely reduced word $w \in F(X)$ with $w=1 \in G$.

[Carrick mat and further development of bipartite knots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17254)
> Alina Pavlikova

Problem $1.60$ in Kirby's list of open problems in topology.

"Which knots possess a matched diagram?"

Conjecture: "There are oriented knots without a matached diagram."(open)

__Alexander Module__

For every subgroup $H$ in $\pi_1(X)$, there is corresponding covering space $\tilde{X}$ whose fundamental group is $H$.

Take $H = [\pi_1(X), \pi_1(X)]$. Then, the projection $p:\tilde{X} \rightarrow X$ induceds $p_* \pi_1(\tilde{X}) \rightarrow \pi_1(X)$ with $p_*\pi_1(\tilde{X}) = [\pi_1(X), \pi_1(X)]$..

Since the covering is __normal__, Deck transformation is isomorphic to $\pi_1(X) / [\pi_1(X), \pi_1(X)] \simeq H_1(X)=\mathbb{Z}$.

Denote the deck transformation of $\tilde{X}$ corresponding to $t$, the generator of $H_1(X)$, by $\tau$.

Note that the abelian group $H_1(\tilde(X))$ is naturally endowed with the structure of a module over a the group ring $\mathbb{Z}[H_1(\tilde{X})]=\mathbb{Z}[t, t^{-1}]$.

This module, $M_K$, is called the _Alexander module_ of a knot $K$.

And.. get a related matrix, build ideals, so on..

[On the Visibility of Alternating +Achiral Knots](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01897)
> Nicola Ermotti, Cam Van Quach Hongler, Claude Weber

It is well-known that many topological invarinats can be detected from a minimal projection $\Pi$ of $K$, crossingnumber, genus, etc.

$\Rightarrow$ __Achirality__?!

A knot $K$ is $+$achiral if there exists as mirror homeo. $\Psi: (S^3, K) \rightarrow (S^3, K)$ which reverses the orientation of $S^3$ but preserves the orientation of $K$

$-$achiral if there exists a mirror homeo. $\Psi: (S^3, K) \rightarrow (S^3, K)$ which reverses the orientation of both $S^3$ and $K$.

[Ihara zeta function and twisted Alexander invariants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00215)
> Zipei Zhuang

Let $q: \mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{F}_n] \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}[\Gamma]$ be an induced homomorphism between the group rings of free group and the fundamental group of a given knot.

nad $\rho:\Gamma \longrightarrow GL(m;\mathbb{F})$ be a representation, and write
$$
\rho_*: \mathbb{Z}(\mathbb{F}_n) \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}GL(m;\mathbb{F}) \subset GL(m;\mathbb{F})
$$
for the ring homomorphism induced by $\rho$.

Denoete $\Phi$ by a composition of $\mathbb{Z}\mathbb{F}_n \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}\Gamma$ and $\rho_* \otimes  \alpha_* : \mathbb{Z}\Gamma \longrightarrow GL(m;\mathbb{F}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}[t, t^{-1}] \subset GL(m;\mathbb{F}[t,t^{-1}])$

and let $A_\rho = (\Phi(\frac{\partial r_i}{\partial x_j})_{i,j})$.

is called __the twisted Alexander matrix__ of $\Gamma$ assiciated to the representation $\rho$.

the twisted Alexander polynomial of $K$ for $\rho$ is defined to be
$$
\Delta_{K, \rho}(t) = \frac{\det A_{\rho, K}}{\det \Phi(x_k - 1)}
$$

Note: twisted $\rightarrow$ usual Alexander polynomial when $\rho$ is the trivial representation. (to $GL(1;\mathbb{R})$)

Let $\Delta$ be a hyperbolic triangle with a fixed area $\phi$, then,

all but countably many $\phi$, generic choices of $\Delta$ have the property that the group generated by the $\pi$-rotations about the midpoints of the sides of the triangle admits no nontrivial relations.

[A Unified Topological Approach to Data Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16926)
> Jelena Grbić, Jie Wu, Kelin Xia, Guo-Wei Wei

Generalize simplicial complexes and hypergraphs to super-hypergraphs, and establish super-hypergraph homology as an extension of simplicial homology.

and super-persistent homology as an application.

Otto: It's just $\mathbb{Z}_2$ grading ㅋ (How to see this?)

A _super-hypergraph_ is a pair $(\mathcal{H}, X)$ where $X$ is a $\Delta$-set and $\mathcal{H}$ is a graded subset of $X$.

Topology on the super-hypergraph: _Vertex-deletion_ topology, namely, grading function $f_v: \mathcal{H} \longrightarrow \mathbb{N}$ is given by the size of vertices $-1$ in subgraph.

and $\mathcal{H}_n := f^{-1}(n)$.
